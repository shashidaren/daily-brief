          On <strong>August&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2025</strong> a minor <em>3.2‑magnitude earthquake</em> struck near
          the town of Segamat in Johor at 8:59&nbsp;a.m. local time.  The quake,
          centred about 18&nbsp;km south of Segamat along the Mersing Fault Zone, did not
          cause any deaths or injuries, according to Malaysia’s Meteorological
          Department.  Officials reported the tremor was likely an aftershock and
          urged residents to remain calm.  Minor earthquakes like this are
          occasionally felt in Peninsular Malaysia but rarely cause significant
          damage.

          Heavy rains from <strong>Tropical Storm Kajiki</strong> brought extensive flooding
          and landslides across Vietnam and Thailand.  Authorities reported at
          least eight deaths (seven in Vietnam and one in Thailand).  Rainfall
          totals reached around 20&nbsp;cm in some provinces, prompting warnings of
          flash floods and landslides and forcing thousands to evacuate.

        <p>
          The technology sector continues to surge, with investors pricing in
          potential interest‑rate cuts and seeking high‑growth companies.  Market
          analysts note that innovative small‑cap tech firms remain resilient
          despite economic uncertainty.  Meanwhile, enthusiasm around artificial
          intelligence has pushed AI‑linked stocks up roughly <strong>170&nbsp;%</strong>
          since late&nbsp;2022; however, analysts caution that valuations are
          elevated and concentrated among a few mega‑cap companies.

          In Asia, Chinese chipmakers plan to <em>triple</em> their AI chip output by
          2026.  Huawei is developing a dedicated fabrication plant, slated to
          start production by late&nbsp;2025, and the industry plans to build two
          more plants by 2026.  These expansions are intended to reduce reliance
          on foreign technology and support the country’s growing AI industry.

        <p>
          Gold prices eased as investors booked profits and the U.S. dollar
          strengthened.  On Aug&nbsp;27&nbsp;2025, spot gold slipped to around
          <strong>$3,382&nbsp;per&nbsp;ounce</strong>, while December futures fell to
          <strong>$3,430.80</strong>.  Analysts attributed the pull‑back to profit‑taking
          after gold reached a two‑week high.

This is originally a $549 headset that dropped to $400 last year, where it’s mostly stayed since. This headset doesn’t get discounted often outside of big events like Prime Day or Black Friday, so this is a pretty solid deal. You’re looking at a straight-up $101 discount from its usual $400 price. The only time it went lower was a brief dip to $280 that very few were able to grab, and today’s price lands it within just $20 of that all-time low. Today’s discount, which is also matched at <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/n4124a\">Best Buy</a>, marks one of the lowest prices we have tracked for this model, so be sure to snag it after getting more details below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/23/sony-playstation-vr2-headset-lowest-prices-ever-at-299/#more-1194692\">more…</a>",

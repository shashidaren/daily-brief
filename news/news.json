Of course, the most affordable of the three new models and the legacy models is the latest <a href=\"https://whisker.pxf.io/55o7L1\">Whisker Litter-Robot EVO that starts from <strong>$599 shipped</strong></a>, while its <a href=\"https://whisker.pxf.io/PO7406\">3-year warranty bundle is priced at <strong>$699 shipped</strong></a> – both of which aren’t seeing price cuts, sadly, but retain more accessible pricing compared to others. Where the savings start is on the <a href=\"https://whisker.pxf.io/nXYo4a\">Starter Bundle for <strong>$729 shipped</strong></a>, down from $832, and coming with a litter-trap mat, a 3-pack of odor traps, 25 waste drawer liners, a 20-pound bag of litter, and a 3-year extended warranty, which comes in $53 under the pricing we saw during Black Friday and Christmas sales for a new all-time low. Head below to browse the full lineup of new and legacy offers during this event.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/13/whisker-valentines-day-sale-litter-robot-from-599/#more-1191892\">more…</a>",

This particular display debuted a few months ago carrying a $900 price tag, and it’s now seeing a $300 discount. It saw its first big discount when it dropped to $700 during the recent fall Prime Day sale, shortly after which it hit the $650 mark. Today’s deal – which is matched at Amazon – shaves an additional $50 off its previous all-time low and our mention from last month to mark a new best price to beat. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this model, and you’ll also find the <a href=\"https://howl.link/7v516ichr02uh\">40-inch variant of this display at <strong>$750 low</strong></a> right now.

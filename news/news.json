One notable drop during this sale is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Permanent-Lighting-Waterproof-Assistant/dp/B0DX1WPB9J/ref=sr_1_1?tag=toysrein-20\">200-foot Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro back at <strong>$479.99 shipped</strong></a> for the second-ever time, while its 100 and 150-foot models are also down at returning lows starting from $279.99 shipped. Normally fetching $760 without price cuts, we’ve seen discounts mostly keeping this model at $600 over the year, with previous one-time falls to $560 and the $480 low, which was during July’s Prime Day event. Now, while these 37% savings last, you can bring home the most extensive of the brand’s pro-tier outdoor lighting for a second-ever chance at the lowest price we have tracked. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/07/govee-permanent-outdoor-lights-pro-from-280-low-more/#more-1166381\">more…</a>",

While it carries a $170 MSRP, it’s coming down from its more recent $142 rate that it’s been holding to in the new year, beating out all the prior discounts we’ve seen since July 2025. Considering that the Greenworks dethatcher/scarifier is only available in a $150 used condition, while Sun Joe’s model has been keeping to its full $160 price since mid-December, this is certainly the most affordable option for brand-new equipment that gives you budget-friendly functionality.

Be sure to enter promo code <strong>GAMER</strong> during checkout. This particular gamepad typically goes for $100 at Amazon, so you’re looking at a $56 discount on it right now. It’s available in <a href=\"https://howl.link/t9ogrhtbroabq\">black</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/t9ogrhtbroabq\">white</a> colors, and they’re both down to the $44 low today. We previously saw this gamepad in white drop to $58 as part of one of Woot’s previous video game sales, but today’s discounted price – when paired with the promo code – shaves an additional $14 off to mark a new best price to beat. Woot is also offering the <a href=\"https://howl.link/j7tft8wapazt7\">wireless V3 Pro model in white for <strong>$119.99 shipped</strong></a> when you enter the same promo code, which is also the lowest price we have tracked for it to date.

Coming down from its full $170 rate, giving you a 22% markdown on a more unique and even safer outdoor cutting solution that protects you far more than traditional chainsaws, especially when using it directly on the ground. While we have seen it go lower in the past, today’s deal lands the price just $3 above its Black Friday rate, giving you a solid $38 savings in the process.

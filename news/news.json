Carrying a $700 MSRP since launching back at the top of October, we’ve only seen this model given $100 price cuts in its launch deal and the brand’s Halloween and early Black Friday sales. Now, with things having ramped up with increased savings now that Black Friday is in full swing, you can score a larger-than-ever $200 markdown to a new all-time low price, giving you an advanced upgrade to your commute that I have been loving so far since getting one a short time ago. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/28/segway-e3-pro-electric-scooter-new-500-black-friday-low/#more-1180033\">more…</a>",

Aside from returns like the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59181&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.ecoflow.com%2Fpages%2Fhalloween-sale%3Fref%3Dbrandsitebanner\">new DELTA 3 Pro home backup bundle low</a>, you’ll find other returning offers like the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59181&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.ecoflow.com%2Fpages%2Fhalloween-sale%3Fref%3Dbrandsitebanner\">DELTA Pro Ultra Smart Extra Battery at <strong>$1,899 shipped</strong></a>, which beats out Amazon’s pricing by $200. While it carries a $3,299 MSRP directly from the brand, the price is normally kept down between $2,299 and $2,099, though we have seen two previous falls to $1,899, as well as a dip further to the one-time $1,884 low during Prime Day three weeks ago. You’re getting another shot at the next-best price we have tracked, saving you $901 off the going rate ($1,400 off the MSRP).

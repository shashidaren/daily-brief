Coming down off its $130 full price tag, we saw regular discounts taking the costs down to $90 until July, when that month’s Prime Day event first gave us the first drop to this rate, which has been regularly returning in the months since. While it has gone lower in the past, you’re still getting another shot at this solid 43% markdown that cuts $45 off the tag for one of its lowest prices at Amazon. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/07/redtigers-f7np-dual-dash-cam-85-low/#more-1174438\">more…</a>",

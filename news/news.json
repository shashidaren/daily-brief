Among the lineup, which you can see in full here, we spotted the brand’s S14 Plus Robot Vacuum and Mop down at <strong><s>$599.99 shipped</s></strong>. This model was released with a $1,400 price tag back in March, but has since come down to a starting $1,200 rate, with discounts having kept the price down at $700 since mid-August. Now, you can score it lower than ever – even beating Prime Day pricing – as it’s getting a 50% markdown to a new all-time low price. For folks not looking to spend so much, there’s also the M12 Pro+ robot back at its lowest $359.99 shipped pricing too.

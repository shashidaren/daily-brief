This new model hit the market with its many counterparts back in September and is coming down from its $2,899 MSRP here today, which we’ve mostly seen taken down to $1,499 in past sales, with a fall lower to $1,424 back during Black Friday. The deal here is only lasting until 3 a.m. PST and gives you an up to 53% markdown that cuts $1,540 off the tag for the lowest new price we have tracked.

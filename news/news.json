This is a newer mower amongst the lineup, which is coming down off its usual $450 tag for a lower price than we normally see, with things having mostly kept above $360 over the year. Things finally dropped lower for the first time during July’s Prime Day, when costs were taken down to $328, with today’s deal only beaten out by the $273 low that popped up for a short time last month. If you missed out there, you can get it here at the next-best rate, which cuts $135 off the tag and gives you a more advanced electric mowing solution.

That’s right, the savings train is pulling into the brick-built station, with some sets seeing their best prices to date, like the LEGO Star Wars Grogu with Hover Pram set at $49.99 shipped. You’d have to pay $100 buying this set directly from LEGO, but at Amazon we’ve been seeing prices fluctuate recently between $80 and $63, until today’s deal popped up taking things lower-than-ever with a 50% markdown to a new all-time low. This 1,048-piece set lets you recreate the adorable Grogu from The Mandalorian, complete with posable features and some accessories, including his hover pram that he can sit inside. Head below for a lineup of the best LEGO early Black Friday Amazon deals that we’re seeing right now, broken down into two separate lists for your holiday needs. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/14/lego-amazon-early-black-friday-sale-from-7/#more-1176237\">more…</a>",

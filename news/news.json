Don’t forget to enter promo codes <strong>BUYMORELENOVO</strong> and <strong>LEGIONSAVE10</strong> during checkout to see the discounted price. You are looking at a massive $1,121 discount on this tower that carries a $2,800 price tag, and it marks the lowest price we have tracked for it.

Today’s deal delivers some serious value under $1,700, considering the same PC with an Ultra 7 processor and an RTX 5060 Ti itself is currently going for <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/19LELx\">$1,600 at Best Buy</a>.

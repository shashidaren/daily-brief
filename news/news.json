This is regularly a $40 unit, which is now seeing a straight-up $22 markdown. Today’s 55% discount lands it $2 below its previous all-time low and our mention from last month when it hit $20 as part of Amazon’s early Prime Big Deal Day sale. The entire Blink Mini 2 lineup, which includes both 2- and 3-pack along with the outdoor adapter, has hit a new all-time low today, so be sure to grab them. While the newer Blink Mini 2K+ offers sharper 2K resolution, the current discount on the original Blink Mini 2 makes it an easy recommendation.

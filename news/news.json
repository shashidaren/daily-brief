We’ve seen it previously dip to $20 a few times, but today’s deal takes an extra $2 off, marking the lowest price we’ve tracked for it so far. This slim tracking card is a good option to consider if you’re like me and don’t love the idea of stuffing an AirTag into your wallet and adding unnecessary bulk.

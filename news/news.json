If you’re waiting to jump into this one on Switch 2 when it releases starting next week, the original Hades game is a great way to tide you over and you can now <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hades-switch/\">score it down at just <strong>$6.24</strong></a> on the eShop, down from the regular $25. Hades II takes place some time after the events of the first game and in the same universe – jumping into the first game makes for a great primer ahead of the sequel’s release. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nintendo-switch-2-now-up-for-purchase-at-amazon-with-no-invitation-needed-have-any-store-credit-to-use\"><a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/19/nintendo-switch-2-now-purchase-amazon/\">Nintendo Switch 2 now up for purchase at Amazon with no invitation needed…have any store credit to use?</a></h2>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/19/hades-switch-ii-deals/#more-1161886\">more…</a>",

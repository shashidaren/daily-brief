Amongst the massive lineup of deals, we spotted <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/YRa2vm\">Anker’s new SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station with a FREE protective cover ($99 value) dropping to <strong>$1,449 shipped</strong></a> right now, which beats out Amazon’s pricing by $50 that doesn’t come with any cover. It’s been carrying a $2,599 full price since hitting the market in June, which we’ve seen drop as low as $1,599 until today, which was the one-time rate seen during July’s Prime Day event. Now the costs are going lower than ever, as you score $1,249 in savings at a new all-time low price.

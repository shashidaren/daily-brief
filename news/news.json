This two-pack normally sells for $300, but it’s now down by a hefty 49%, knocking $147 off the usual going rate. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this dual node system to date, undercutting its previous Black Friday low by another $36. It’s a particularly compelling deal considering a single node on its own is currently fetching $135.

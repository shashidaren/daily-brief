A new branch of Autel’s devices, these models have spent the time since their release in August through October keeping to their $299 and $399 price tags, which we’ve been seeing steadily ramping up discounts since early Black Friday sales. First they received cuts to $249 and $299, with the 2-cam pack then going lower to $199, while the 4-cam dropped to $254. Today’s deal brings larger-than-ever $143 and $200 markdowns off their full tag rates, landing them at new all-time low prices just in time to score them ahead of Christmas. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/11/autel-outdoor-cams-with-solar-panels-local-storage-hdmi-from-156/#more-1183105\">more…</a>",

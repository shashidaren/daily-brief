This particular model hit the scene earlier this year in January carrying a $160 price tag. It dropped to the $136 mark for the first time a few months back, and its current fall Prime Day offer takes 21% off its usual going rate. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this gimbal, and it’s now fetching $9 less than its previous low and our mention from July. Both black and white variants of this gimbal have hit the $127 low today, and you’ll find its Creator bundle with some neat extras fetching <strong>$132.99 shipped</strong> instead of its usual $190 price.

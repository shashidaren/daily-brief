Normally going for $700 in full, we saw this model spending the final week of December at this rate before rising back in price for just one day. The deal here has only been beaten out by the drops to $474 back during Black Friday and the $470 low we spotted in early-to-mid-December, with you able to save $220 off the going rate right now, giving you the third-lowest price we have tracked. While this is a versatile robot for in-ground of above-ground pools, folks with above-ground swimming holes can save a bit more by going with the Scuba SE Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner at <strong>$139.99 shipped</strong>, which has been serving my brother well for over a year now. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/02/aiper-scuba-s1-robot-pool-cleaner-480/#more-1186000\">more…</a>",

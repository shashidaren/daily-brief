That solar generator package bundles <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59181&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.ecoflow.com%2Fpages%2Fblack-friday%3Fref%3Dbrandsitebanner\">EcoFlow’s DELTA Pro Portable Power Station with a 400W solar panel and a FREE protective bag for <strong>$1,799 shipped</strong></a>, which matches Amazon’s pricing on the same bundle, minus the free bag (valued at $99). While it carries a $4,898 MSRP direct from the brand, the bagless package can often be found starting lower at $3,999 at Amazon, with discounts having taken costs as low as $1,799 before a former early Black Friday flash sale (also without a free bag) dropped things to $1,599 for the first time (costing you $1,698 total to add the bag there). The deal here provides you with the next-best price to date, giving you $2,200 off the going rate and $3,099 off the MSRP. Head below to check out the full lineup of flash deals lasting through November 22.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/21/ecoflow-black-friday-delta-pro-generator-more-from-1189/#more-1178433\">more…</a>",

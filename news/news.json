While it has gone a little further in past years, you’re still looking at a $150 markdown that lands it at the best price of the year. Of course, you could save a bit more by choosing the brand’s smaller Classic Series 4.5-Quart Tilt-Head Mixer at $279 shipped, or the Artisan Mini 3.5-Quart Tilt-Head Mixer at <strong>$299.95 shipped</strong>.

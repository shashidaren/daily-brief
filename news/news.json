This is a fairly new model in the brand’s Nitro lineup that hit the scene carrying a $350 price tag. It saw its first big markdown when it dropped to $300 for Prime Day earlier this year, but today’s deal steps it up with an additional discount. It’s now fetching $60 less than its previous all-time low, making this a great time to cash in. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this display, and it’s a capable model that can swtich between 1080p 320Hz and 4K 160Hz modes based on the kind of gameplay experience you’re looking for.

That’s a straight-up $650 discount on its $2,000 usual going rate and one of the lowest prices we have tracked for it to date. Today’s 32% markdown on its usual going rate lands it within just $38 of the all-time low price it hit earlier this year. We recently saw the standard 240Hz WQHD variant of this monitor go for less, but this particular model has dual-mode support with which you can push it up to 330Hz for competitive gaming. You can learn more about it below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/19/lg-45-inch-5k2k-330hz-dual-mode-oled-gaming-monitor-650-off/#more-1194152\">more…</a>",

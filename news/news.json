Originally priced at $85, this USB-C charger has more recently hovered around $70 on Amazon. Today’s deal drops it by $25, bringing it within just $3.50 of the lowest price we’ve seen there. It briefly hit $35 at <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/xLvO7v\">Best Buy</a> during last year’s Prime Day, which only a few were able to grab before it sold out. It’s now fetching one of the best prices we’ve tracked, making this a great time to cash in if you’ve been wanting to replace a bulky old charger with something compact.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/21/anker-100w-3-port-gan-prime-charger-now-down-to-one-of-its-lowest-prices/#more-1188928\">more…</a>",

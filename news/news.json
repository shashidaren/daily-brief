This is a new addition to the Barracuda X Chroma lineup that recently hit the scene alongside other Phantom White accessories carrying a $140 price tag. This model saw its first discount earlier this month when it hit $120, but today’s deal shaves an additional $19 off to mark one of the lowest prices we have tracked for it to date. It briefly dropped below $100 earlier today, but is now hovering at the $101 mark with a 28% discount. You can also get this in black and white finishes, although they’re both fetching $120 with a relatively lighter discount.

      "summary": "PUTRAJAYA: The Syariah High Court on Wednesday (Dec 17) allowed businessman Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin to file a preliminary objection against his father, Sapura Holdings Sdn Bhd founder Tan Sri Shamsuddin Abdul Kadir's application to confirm a hibah involving 14.8 million units of company shares. Shamsuddin, 94, filed the application on Sept 2 seeking confirmation of the hibah granted 28 years ago to his two sons, Shahril, 64, and Datuk Shahriman Shamsuddin, 56, each involving 14.8 million units of shares. The confirmation is a legal prerequisite for Shamsuddin to revoke the hibah, which he is seeking to do against Shahril, who is also the chief executive officer of Sapura Group, citing personal reasons. Syariah Judge Ahmad Irwan Ismail ordered Shahril to file the preliminary objection within three weeks and fixed Feb 24, 2026 for further mention of the case.  \"The first defendant (Shahril) is allowed to file a notice of motion for objection together with a supporting affidavit,\" the judge said.  Earlier, syariah lawyer Dr Mohd Rafie Mohd Shafie, representing Shahril, told the court that the hibah in dispute was fasid (invalid) and that the objection was raised to challenge the basis of the plaintiff's claims.  However, syariah lawyer Suhaimi Saad, representing Shamsuddin, objected to the application, arguing there was no error in his client's claim and that a father has the right to revoke a hibah given to a child.  Meanwhile, syariah lawyer Fakhrul Azman Abu Hasan, representing Shahriman, said his client did not object to the application for confirmation of the hibah.- Bernama <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/12/17/court-allows-sapura-founder039s-son-to-file-objection-over-hibah-confirmation\">Read full story</a>",

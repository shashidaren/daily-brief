Down from its full $1,200 price tag, we saw discounts over the last year since its March 2025 release go as low as $520 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday and Christmas sales. Now, you can bring home the same advanced system that has served me well with an even lower price, thanks to the $700 markdown, landing it at a new all-time low price. You can also save a bit more while still getting some advanced autonomous cleaning (not as advanced as the S14 Plus) by going with the M12 Ultra Plus robot that is down at its $339.99 low.

Of course, the biggest deals during this new event are on <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/nXkvj9\">Lectric’s XPedition 2 Cargo e-bikes</a>, with the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/RGRNdy\">standard 13Ah e-bike getting a $346 bundle at <strong>$1,399 shipped</strong></a>, while the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/7aMQAV\">26Ah dual-battery e-bike is getting a $545 bundle at <strong>$1,799 shipped</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/OeaxRN\">35Ah dual-battery long-range e-bike is seeing the $694 bundle at <strong>$1,999 shipped</strong></a>. Without the usual savings on the bundles themselves, as is common during Lectric’s sale events, you’d have to pay either $1,745, $2,344, or $2,693 for these same packages at full price. They may not be the largest bundles like we saw during Black Friday and the previous holiday sale events, but you’re still saving a significant amount – up to $693 – while also upgrading to one of America’s most popular cargo-hauling solutions.

Normally fetching $450 at full price, discounts over the year have largely kept costs above $330, save for a few drops to the $292 low until Prime Day cut the tag to $305. If you missed out on the two-day-only Prime rate, you can get it for just $15 higher in price while these savings last. You’re still getting a solid $130 markdown here, which lands it at the third-lowest price we have tracked and equips you with the latest and most powerful of the brand’s electric pressure washers. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/09/greenworks-pro-3000-psi-electric-pressure-washer-320/#more-1167476\">more…</a>",

This bundle debuted a few months after the camera’s original launch carrying a $480 price tag, and it comes with a pre-installed Ultra Wide lens mod right out of the box. Today’s deal shaves $150 off its usual going rate to land it back at the lowest price we first tracked for it in August. This discounted bundle delivers serious value at the discounted price today as the HERO13 Black action camera itself is fetching $360 right now without the lens mod. Head below for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/09/gopro-hero13-black-ultra-wide-edition-back-to-330-low/#more-1167131\">more…</a>",

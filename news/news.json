This 14-inch model hit the scene about a year ago with a $470 price tag, and today’s deal delivers a straight-up $170 discount on it. It dropped to $370 ahead of the fall Prime Day sale in September, but today’s Black Friday offer beats that by a wide margin to deliver the lowest price we have tracked for it to date. Also, the bundle discounted today includes the tablet, a T-Pen stylus, and a flip case, making it a solid package if you’re after a reliable Android tablet for everyday use.

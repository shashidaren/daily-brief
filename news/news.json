Starting on the lower end of the pricing, you can currently find <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/kOLMaV\">Anker’s SOLIX C1000 Gen 1 Portable Power Station bundled with an expansion battery and a water-resistant bag for <strong>$729 shipped</strong></a>, which beats out its bagless option at Amazon by $141. This package would fetch you $1,898 without any discounts, and hasn’t been featured like this in past sales, instead being split into two separate bundles. Considering the expanded setup has gone as low as $699, and the water-resistant bag on its own has gone as low as $80 (meaning $779 total with their best pricing), this bundle with all three certainly seems to be the lowest price you could score them with, complete with $1,169 savings. There’s also the newer and more compact <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/6yjWd3\">C1000 Gen 2 Power Station down at <strong>$429 shipped</strong></a>, and matching its Amazon pricing.

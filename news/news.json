Now set for release on October 13, if you’re looking to secure a boxed copy for your collection, Amazon’s physical deluxe copy is now live with some extra goodies – a digital art book and soundtrack, new quests for a series of new armor, weapons, and horse armor sets, and the expected Shivering Isles &amp; Knights of the Nine story expansions. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/30/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical/#more-1164369\">more…</a>",

While the power station on its own carries a $2,599 MSRP and can usually be found starting for around $1,600 at Amazon, this newer bundle sits with a higher $2,797 starting rate, which we saw go as low as $1,199 in the first iteration of this sale, when the power station was also at the same price, which happens to be the standalone all-time low. Now, despite the station sitting $100 higher, you can still technically score it at its lowest tracked price while gaining the additional adapter cables, making this all the better of a deal, as they allow for connections to any gas generator or EV charger you may already own. We’ve also rounded up some additional bundles for this series below. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/27/anker-solix-f3000-power-station-1199-low-with-adapter-cables/#more-1190043\">more…</a>",

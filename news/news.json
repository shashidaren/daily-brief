Folks without a Prime membership can dodge the shipping fee by checking out with items worth over $35 in the cart. This model launched last year at $24 with early-bird offers on Kickstarter, shortly after which it landed on Amazon carrying a $36 price tag. The white one has lately been fetching $30 at Amazon, and today’s deal shaves $10 off its usual going rate to land it $4 below its early bird launch price. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this mouse, and you can learn more about it below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/06/esr-magmouse-with-built-in-usb-c-cable-now-at-20-amazon-all-time-low/#more-1186536\">more…</a>",

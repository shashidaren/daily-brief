It may not be the fastest unit out there – speeds top out at 7.5W for iPhone, 5W for AirPods, and 2.5W for Apple Watch – but it’s pretty good for overnight charging or in places where you don’t need the fastest charging speeds. What we love about this model is that it folds into a slim, pocketable form-factor when not in use, making it super compact and easy to carry around. The brand even includes a 20W charger and a Type-C cable to go with it.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 27px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/08/29/foldable-3-in-1-magsafe-travel-charger-adapter-cable-56-off/#more-1156784\">more…</a>",

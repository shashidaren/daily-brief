Today’s deal is dropping even further than ever before, giving you a 43% markdown that cuts $650 from the tag for the best new price we have tracked, just in time to pick it up during your Black Friday shopping. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/17/roborock-qrevo-curvx-robot-vac-mop-new-850-low/#more-1176929\">more…</a>",

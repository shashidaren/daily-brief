This particular listing also includes the magnetic set, which adds a snap-on case and ring so you can attach the drive to your phone or laptop.

Down from a $330 full price, it’s been mostly keeping between $250 and $220 over the last year, with falls popping up regularly to $200 and $190 (the latter having last been seen during July’s Prime Day event). The deal here gives you a 39% markdown that cuts $130 off the going rate, landing it at the  best price in the last seven months and the second-best price of the last year, making it a far more affordable option over the latest Xtreme 4 speaker that is sitting at $370 right now, down from its $380 full price. We’ve also rounded up a collection of JBL’s other speakers, headphones, and earbuds benefiting from discounts below. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/26/jbl-xtreme-3-portable-bluetooth-speaker-200-more-from-31/#more-1195500\">more…</a>",

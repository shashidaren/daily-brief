Those offers join ongoing all-time lows on the brand new M5 MacBook Pro at $250 off, M4 MacBook Air with at least <strong>$250</strong> in savings, loads of iPad deals, and one of the best values in Black Friday Mac deals, the venerable M4 Mac mini from just $479. Of course, Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and the more affordable SE models are also joining the extended Black Friday party as well – scope everything out below </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/29/apple-deals-black-friday-weekend-airpods-m5-macbook-pro/#more-1180431\">more…</a>",

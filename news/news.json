Don’t forget to enter promo codes <strong>WEEKENDPOWERUP</strong> and <strong>BUYMORELENOVO</strong> to see the discounted price during checkout. We saw the RTX 5070 Ti variant of this notebook see a huge $650 discount last week, but Lenovo is cutting even deeper on its top-tier Legion Pro 7i configuration this time. For comparison, <a href=\"https://bhpho.to/3KbQgTh\">B&amp;H is listing the same model at <strong>$3,399</strong></a> with a relatively lighter discount, while Best Buy has a similar build with 32GB of RAM (instead of 64GB) priced at <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/9L6430\">$3,330</a>. That makes today’s deal one of the strongest values around for Lenovo’s flagship gaming notebook and the lowest we can find.

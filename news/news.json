Over at Woot, however, you will find the Switch version marked down from the regular $60 to<strong> <a href=\"https://howl.link/vqdfwslxcil7f\">$44.99</a></strong><a href=\"https://howl.link/vqdfwslxcil7f\"> with free shipping for Prime members</a> (a $6 delivery fee will apply otherwise). This is indeed the Latin America Version of the game with a Spanish cover, but “all Nintendo Switch Video Games are Region Free and will function normally in any Switch console. Units ship with Spanish as the main language and English as the secondary language on the packaging.” Again, it might not be exactly what you were after, but it also might kind of an interesting collectible for U.S. gamers too, and it is one of the lowest prices we have tracked on the game to date. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/10/how-to-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-deal/#more-1182710\">more…</a>",

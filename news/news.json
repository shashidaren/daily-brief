Normally $1,799 without discounts, this robot has been keeping down at $1,349 since mid-December, with only a single day’s spike up to its full rate before dropping back down. This is a 25% markdown that has cut $450 off the going rate for the second-lowest price we have tracked, only beaten out by the $1,299 low that we last saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. You can also find three other models from this brand <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/15/mammotion-rtk-robot-lawn-mowers-starting-from-649/\">benefitting from up to 35% savings here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/20/mammotion-yuka-2000-robot-lawn-mower-1349/#more-1188775\">more…</a>",

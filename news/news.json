This particular model hit the scene last year alongside the brand’s Clio head cushion and Basilisk Mobile mouse carrying a $140 price tag. It has lately been fetching $130 at Amazon, but today’s deal shaves an additional $39 off its usual going rate to mark a new best price to beat. This is a timed Lightning deal and it’s already starting to go quick, so be sure to grab it while you can before the price jumps back. Head below for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/06/razer-joro-portable-wireless-gaming-keyboard-new-all-time-low/#more-1186556\">more…</a>",

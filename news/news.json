One notable inclusion is <a href=\"https://ecoflowtechnologyinc.pxf.io/qzbagL\">EcoFlow’s DELTA 3 Plus Portable Power Station with a FREE protective bag at <strong>$599 shipped</strong></a>, after the automatic code is applied in your cart, beating out its Amazon pricing by $50 (which doesn’t include a bag). This is one of the rare cases where the direct website’s $799 MSRP beats out the starting price on other sites like Amazon, where it can be found starting from a $899 price tag, which we’ve seen go as low as $616 in past sales. Now, for the rest of the week, you can score a $200 markdown off the going rate, scoring it at the lowest new price we have tracked.

The biggest of these deals is on the <a href=\"https://go.ride1up.com/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;aff_id=2069&amp;source=https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy-v2/\">Prodigy V2 Brose Step-Thru Mid-Drive 9-Speed e-bike at <strong>$1,895 shipped</strong></a>, or you can grab its <a href=\"https://go.ride1up.com/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;aff_id=2069&amp;source=https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy-v2/\">step-over variant for <strong>$100 more</strong></a>, otherwise, the alternate option is the <a href=\"https://go.ride1up.com/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;aff_id=2069&amp;source=https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy-v2/\">upgraded Prodigy V2 Belt-Drive model at <strong>$2,595 shipped</strong></a>. The typical chain-drive models would run you $2,495 outside of this sale, while the belt-drive model goes for $2,795, with most of the sales over 2025 having seen costs dropped to $1,995 and $2,595 on average. Once again, the belt-drive variant is retaining its $200 markdown, while the chain-drive models are once again repeating the deals we saw during Black Friday and Christmas for $500/$600 markdowns – with all three back at their lowest tracked prices. You’ll find a large selection of other e-bikes benefitting from discounts below. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/13/ride1up-e-bikes-presidents-day-prodigy-v2-mid-drive-e-bikes-from-1895-more/#more-1193293\">more…</a>",

The e-bike is retaining its previous price cut from a $1,649 MSRP, but instead of getting basic FREE add-on gear, you’re getting the range extender battery (a $400 value) for free – which would cost you a total $2,049 without any of this event’s savings. The last time we saw this same offer was during the brand’s 3-day Christmas flash sale, with the $750 savings and the price for it all being the best deal we have tracked over the last year.

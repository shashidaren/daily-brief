This particular camera grip accessory hit the scene towards the end of last year carrying an $80 price tag.

This is the lowest price we have tracked for this model to date, so you might want to jump in there and snag one before this timed Lightning deal runs out. You can also get this grip in Blue and Sand finishes, although they’re both fetching their full prices right now at $80.

Once again, the belt-drive variant is retaining its $200 markdown, while the chain-drive models are once again repeating the deals we saw during Black Friday and Christmas for $500/$600 markdowns – with all three back at their lowest tracked prices. You’ll find a large selection of other e-bikes benefitting from discounts below. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/13/ride1up-e-bikes-presidents-day-prodigy-v2-mid-drive-e-bikes-from-1895-more/#more-1193293\">more…</a>",

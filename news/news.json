Among them, we spotted <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/2azLJz\">Anker’s new SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station</a> with a FREE 120V generator input adapter dropping down to <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/2azLJz\"><strong>$1,599 shipped</strong></a>, which beats out Amazon’s pricing by $51, and sadly, the extra 5% savings code isn’t valid for these deals. It was already brought down from its $2,599 full price to $1,649 in the sale, with the flash savings here returning it to this rate for the first time since it appeared during July’s Prime Day event. You’re looking at the second-ever chance to pick it up at the best price we have tracked – plus, you’re getting the free adapter cable that is valued at $99 normally, which only sweetens the pot. Head below to see the full lineup of flash deals while they last.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/12/anker-solix-fan-fest-weekend-flash-sale-f3000-1599-more/#more-1160188\">more…</a>",

You can now snag this display for your battlestation down at <strong>$1,099.99 shipped</strong>. This is one of the more pricey models in Samsung’s Odyssey lineup, with a $2,000 regular price, but today’s discounted price shaves $900 off its usual going rate. It’s now going for $216 less than the price we tracked for it last month, marking a new best price to beat at Amazon. We did briefly spot it fetching a wildly low $900 once via a promo code, but that was a short-lived offer that only a very few were able to grab.

Of course, if you jumped on the brand’s early pre-order promotion, you’ll also be getting some additional savings through your registered email, which you can use up until the end of the month. The base setup for this new system (the module and one battery) will carry a $5,799 full price once these launch discounts fade, but for folks who missed out on the pre-order offer, it’s still a solid $1,500 price cut alongside $1,346 in bundled items (a 400W solar panel, AC generator adapter cable, a 120V/240V power strip, and a metal pad) for a combined $2,846 in savings – and more for folks who did pre-order! This sets the bar for future discounts throughout the rest of the year and beyond, so head below to learn more about this system and also to browse the larger bundle options that are also seeing discounts. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/04/anker-solix-e10-smart-hybrid-whole-home-backup-system-from-4299/#more-1191391\">more…</a>",

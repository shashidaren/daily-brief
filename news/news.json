While the power station on its own carries a $2,599 MSRP and can usually be found starting for around $1,600 at Amazon, this newer bundle sits with a higher $2,797 starting rate, which we saw go as low as $1,199 in the first iteration of this sale, when the power station was also at the same price, which happens to be the standalone all-time low. Now, despite the station sitting $100 higher, you can still technically score it at its lowest tracked price while gaining the additional adapter cables, making this all the better of a deal, as they allow for connections to any gas generator or EV charger you may already own.

This model saw its first discount earlier this month when it hit $120, but today’s deal shaves an additional $19 off to mark one of the lowest prices we have tracked for it to date. It briefly dropped below $100 earlier today, but is now hovering at the $101 mark with a 28% discount.

More details in the original post below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just spotted a deal at Amazon that drops Lenovo’s self-charging full-size keyboard in black down to <strong>$60.99 shipped</strong>. This is regularly a $100 keyboard, which is currently fetching its full price directly at the <a href=\"https://howl.link/p400zv148nmu2\">brand’s online store</a>. It briefly hit $60 earlier this month before selling out, and today’s deal lands it within just $1 of that price, making it a good time to cash in. You can also get this in white, although it’s currently sitting at $92.53 shipped with a relatively lighter deal. Head below for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/26/score-lenovos-self-charging-wireless-keyboard-for-your-2026-workstation-while-its-down-to-61-39-off/#more-1188418\">more…</a>",

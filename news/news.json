But we wanted to touch down this morning to highlight Woot’s deal on the new <a href=\"https://howl.link/hgj6thk1r5z0j\">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch</a>. This regularly $70 bundle is relatively rarely on sale outside of these Woot offers and it has now dropped a touch lower <a href=\"https://howl.link/hgj6thk1r5z0j\">at <strong>$58.99 Prime shipped</strong></a>. This is the proper U.S. boxed edition at the lowest price we can find – it is currently down at <a href=\"https://howl.link/x5et74h8xoelc\"><strong>$59.49 shipped</strong></a> via a third-party Walmart if you would prefer to take that route. There is only a Switch version, but there is also a FREE Switch 2 update you can download that “leverages the Nintendo Switch 2’s processing capabilities for an even better adventure.” </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/26/super-mario-galaxy-deals/#more-1185410\">more…</a>",

Originally priced at $150, this model has been hovering around $95 in recent months. Today’s offer knocks an extra $35 off its usual rate – bringing it $10 below its previous all-time low and our mention from last year. The black variant is currently sold out, so you may want to grab this one before it disappears or the deal expires. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for this mouse since launch, and you can learn more about it below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/18/alienware-wireless-gaming-mouse-with-magnetic-snap-on-charger/#more-1193939\">more…</a>",

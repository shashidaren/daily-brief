Among the group, we spotted a notably large bundle being given to Lectric’s <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/kOEWb3\">XPress 750 Long-Range Commuter e-bikes that are getting $424 in FREE gear at <strong>$1,299 shipped</strong></a>, in both its step-thru and step-over designs. This package would normally run you $1,723 without the bundle savings, which beats out all the bundles we’ve seen before that only ever amounted up to $410 in gear. Along with the e-bike (which is one of my favorite commuters over the years), you’ll be getting a rear cargo rack, fenders to go over both tires, an Elite headlight upgrade, a suspension seat post, two adjustable rear-view mirrors, and an accordion-style folding bike lock. Head below for more on this e-bike’s capabilities and the other deals we’re seeing while the sale lasts. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/10/lectric-endless-summer-sale-424-bundle-xpress-750-1299-more/#more-1159724\">more…</a>",

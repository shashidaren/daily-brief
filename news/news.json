Prices have been adjusted below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By way of its official Amazon storefront, Jackery has dropped its new <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFSLG3WZ?tag=toysrein-20\">HomePower 3000 Portable Power Station down to its lowest rate of <strong><s>$1,499 shipped</s></strong></a>, which has several discounted bundle options (listed below the fold) and is matching <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/vPkGVy\">the price we’re currently seeing from the brand’s direct website</a>. This new backup power solution has only been on the market since May, normally carrying a $2,499 full price tag, which we’ve mostly seen drop down between $1,899 and $1,699, though recently it’s fallen to $1,599 on Amazon and the $1,499 low during the most recent direct sale. Now that low price is sliding over to Amazon for the first time, giving you $1,000 off the going rate. You can also find the launch deals on the brand’s new <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/12/jackery-early-bird-homepower-3600-plus-starting-from-1699/\">HomePower 3600 Plus station and bundles starting from <strong>$1,699</strong></a> through September 21.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/22/jackery-homepower-3000-1499-low-bundles-from-1799/#more-1160877\">more…</a>",

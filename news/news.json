This is one of the brand’s 2025 releases that hit the market back in April for $850, but has since been hiked up to $1,000 directly from Segway since May’s tariff increases – though, you can find it down at that original rate over at Amazon. Before May, we saw discounts go as low as $600, while our post-tariff market has now only seen costs taken as low as $700, which is where we saw it during Black Friday.

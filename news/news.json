Don’t forget to <em>clip the on-page coupon</em> to see the discounted price during checkout. This is regularly a $180 unit that has been holding close to full price recently, aside from a few dips into the $130 to $140 range. By clipping the on-page coupon, however, you can shave a solid $60 off its usual going rate, landing it within $5 of the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model in white. You can also get this in black, though it’s currently going for $129.99 shipped with a relatively lighter discount.

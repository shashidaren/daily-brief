Coming down from its full $450 price tag, this rate first appeared in November and has since been repeating a few times through December’s holiday season, with the price otherwise having kept at $300 or $400 with discounts. You’re not only getting another chance at the best price we have tracked, but also the first 2026 opportunity here, saving you $190 on a bike carrier for your vehicle that can carry up to 200 pounds (so e-bike transport is best supported here). There’s also the brand’s first-generation platform style carrier that can hold up to 150 pounds at its low of <strong>$169.99 shipped</strong>, while the second-generation hanging style carrier that holds up to 165 pounds and up to four bikes is also at its low of <strong>$159.99 shipped</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/22/bougerv-bike-carriers-up-to-200-pounds-at-lows-from-160/#more-1189134\">more…</a>",

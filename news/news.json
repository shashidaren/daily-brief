That means you’re saving a total of $60, which is a solid 40% off a wireless keyboard and mouse duo worth $150. What makes this deal particularly noteworthy is that the Wave Keys keyboard alone is currently selling for $70, so you’re essentially getting the Lift Vertical mouse for just $20.

One of the top member-only picks from the lineup is <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59271&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluettipower.com%2Fproducts%2Fac200l-sp200l%3Fvariant%3D46352241361115\">Bluetti’s AC200L Portable Power Station with a 200W solar panel at <strong>$1,099 shipped</strong></a>, which sadly can’t stack our exclusive 5% off savings code on top, but is matching the price over at Amazon.

This 4-day only deal comes as an $800 markdown off the going rate, landing it down at the third-lowest price we have tracked, though it is the best price we have seen in 2026 so far.

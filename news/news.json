This is regularly a $500 display that recently hit the scene as part of <a href=\"https://howl.link/wfr25d1h0d6i3\">Samsung’s Smart Monitor lineup</a>. It dropped to the $380 mark earlier this month during the fall Prime Day sale at Amazon, but today’s deal at Woot steps it up with an additional $20 discount. This is the lowest we have seen this 43-inch M70F variant fetch to date, so be sure to cash in before it jumps back up to its full price. Alternatively, you can save more on this monitor if you don’t mind <a href=\"https://howl.link/m3u72k8dsaser\">picking up an open box unit directly from Samsung at <strong>$319.99 shipped</strong></a>.

Amazon is currently offering LG’s 2025 UltraGear 27-inch QHD 300Hz IPS gaming display for $226.99 shipped. This model debuted last year with a $450 price tag and held close to that price until it first dropped to $267 during last year’s Black Friday sale. It briefly dipped further to the $247 mark shortly after that before climbing back, but today’s deal knocks off another $20 to mark a best price to beat.

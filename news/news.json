This is one of the mid-range models in the brand’s RTX 50-series laptop lineup that typically goes for $1,200, and it’s now seeing a $300 discount. It previously dipped to $850 during the holiday season late last year, so it’s now sitting just $50 above its all-time low. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve tracked for this notebook, it still delivers a great value, especially with similarly specced MSI machines currently priced well above $1,200 at retailers like <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/Jkb0ae\">Best Buy</a> and Amazon.

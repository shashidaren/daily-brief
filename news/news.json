Having been released back in November with an original $2,999 MSRP, the price has since been cut to $2,699 when at full directly from Bluetti’s website, whereas it starts from $1,899 at Amazon. We saw Black Friday and Christmas sales take this model lowest to $1,299, with exclusive savings giving us this same rate we’re seeing again here. You’ll be getting $678 off the going rate during this event ($1,478 off the MSRP) and another shot at the lowest price we have tracked so far. Head below to also browse the full lineup of deals while they’re sticking around. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/09/bluetti-new-year-sale-power-stations-exclusive-savings-from-119/#more-1187218\">more…</a>",

Of the bunch, many of which are hitting new and returning low prices, the brand’s M12 Pro+ Robot Vacuum and Mop has dropped down to $359.99 shipped. It would normally cost you $800 without any savings, but we’re seeing it get the largest of the brand’s discounts during this event, which drops it $20 lower than any price we have tracked to date. You can take advantage of this 55% markdown to save $440 off the going rate at its all-time lowest price.

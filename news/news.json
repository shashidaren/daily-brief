This is the base model from Microsoft’s latest portable Xbox lineup, which launched at $600 only a few months ago, and today’s $110 price cut marks the lowest price we’ve tracked for it to date. It comes in $10 under the previous all-time low we saw briefly at <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/aOJO5N\">Best Buy</a> during its Black Friday sale. It’s not often that a new, Xbox-branded gaming console sees such a steep discount this early, so you might want to jump on this offer if you’ve been eyeing a new handheld for the holidays. Amazon’s listing also includes 3 months of Game Pass Premium for free, making this an even better deal overall.

One notable standout is the latest <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59181&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.ecoflow.com%2Fpages%2Fholiday-sale%3Fref%3Dbrandsitebanner\">DELTA 3 Max Plus Portable Power Station with a FREE Trail 200 DC 60,000mAh power station ($200 value) at <strong>$1,049 shipped</strong></a>, which beats out its Amazon pricing by $50 (and that offer doesn’t include the free extra station either). We saw this same bundle offered as an early Black Friday flash deal at $1,099 from the station’s $1,899 MSRP, though at Amazon, it’s been regularly falling to $1,099 and even dropped as low as $1,044 the week of Black Friday, though again, there was no bonus station bundled with it. All-in-all, with the bundled TRAIL station, you’re getting $850 savings here ($1,050 considering the TRAIL’s $200 value) for the next two days, landing these two units down at the best price we have tracked. Head below to learn more and check out the three other flash offers while they’re still around. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/12/ecoflow-48-hour-xmas-flash-sale-delta-3-max-trail-200-new-1049-low-more/#more-1183350\">more…</a>",

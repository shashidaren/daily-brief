Among the offers this time around, you can find <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/EE1g5P\">Jackery’s newest HomePower 3600 Plus Portable Power Station at <strong>$1,614.05 shipped</strong></a>, <em>after using the code <strong>OFFER5 </strong>at checkout</em>, which beats out Amazon’s pricing by $85. This all-new model just hit the market in September with a $2,799 MSRP, which we’ve only seen fall lower to $1,599 and $1,499 in the lead-up and through Prime Day last month. You’re still looking at $1,185 combined savings to the third-lowest price we have tracked, which beats out the more regular $1,699 to $1,799 price we tend to see on it.

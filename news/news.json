Now might be a good time to load up your account and you can do so on Amazon where you will still find 1-month subs/extensions down at $19.99 and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TGNFVWV/?tag=toysj-20&amp;th=1\">3-months options at <strong>$59.99 </strong>a month</a>. You can alternatively score 3-months of PC Game Pass at $35.99, which converts to 2-months of Ultimate (that’s $18 per month). There’s no telling how much longer this will work, or how much longer pricing will remain at $20/month via proper retailers – jump in while you can. There are some slightly sketchy sites out there with lower prices still, but many of them end up being more hassle than not much of the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-major-revamp-a-major-price-hike-and-some-major-upgrades\"><a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-major-revamp-price-hikes-new-tier/\">Xbox Game Pass is getting a major revamp, a major price hike, and some major upgrades</a></h3>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/02/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hikes-load-up/#more-1164940\">more…</a>",

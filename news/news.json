Don’t forget to <em>clip the $200 off coupon</em> to see the discounted price during checkout. Though this carries a $1,300 price tag at B&amp;H, it has fetched as much as $1,600 in recent months at Amazon, so you’re looking at a straight-up 56% markdown on it right now. Today’s deal shaves $900 off its usual going rate, landing it $85 below its previous all-time low. There’s also a 34-inch variant of this model at Amazon if you think that might be a better pick overall for your desk, and it’s fetching $729 at the moment with a relatively lighter deal. Head below for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/29/lg-ultragear-39-inch-240hz-wqhd-oled-curved-gaming-monitor-56-off/#more-1190422\">more…</a>",

Normally going for $1,649 at full price, we haven’t seen very much by way of discounts dropping the cost back at or below $1,400 since April, save for the Prime Day fall to $1,350. While it has gone lower before April, you’re still looking at a solid $249 price cut here that gives you the best rate of the last seven months. Of course, if you want to save more, there’s the brand’s 56V 21-inch Cordless Snow Blower that comes with two 5.0Ah batteries at <strong>$699 shipped</strong> right now, as well as the <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/03/ego-56v-12-inch-cordless-snow-shovel-270/\">56V 12-inch Cordless Snow Shovel with a 2.5Ah battery at $269.99 shipped</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/03/ego-56v-24-inch-cordless-snow-blower-1400-more/#more-1173176\">more…</a>",

Among the lineup, which you can see in full here, we spotted the brand’s S14 Plus Robot Vacuum and Mop down at <strong><s>$599.99 shipped</s></strong>. This model was released with a $1,400 price tag back in March, but has since come down to a starting $1,200 rate, with discounts having kept the price down at $700 since mid-August. Now, you can score it lower than ever – even beating Prime Day pricing – as it’s getting a 50% markdown to a new all-time low price. For folks not looking to spend so much, there’s also the M12 Pro+ robot back at its lowest $359.99 shipped pricing too.

These packages at full price would cost you $1,738 and $1,703 without the discounts on the bundled gear, which beats out both the Prime Day Sales’ bundle sizes from July and last week. Those bundles provide you with a rear cargo rack, a fender set, a suspension seatpost, and an Elite headlight upgrade – with the difference being in the mystery gift amounts ($103 vs. $68).

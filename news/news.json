Among the lineup, which you can see in full here, we spotted the brand’s S14 Plus Robot Vacuum and Mop down at <strong>$599.99 shipped</strong>. This model was released with a $1,400 price tag back in March, but has since come down to a starting $1,200 rate, with discounts having kept the price down at $700 since mid-August. Now, you can score it lower than ever – even beating Prime Day pricing – as it’s getting a 50% markdown to a new all-time low price. For folks not looking to spend so much, there’s also the M12 Pro+ robot back at its lowest $359.99 shipped pricing too.

It would normally cost you $169 at full price, though it would be surprising to pay so much in 2025, as discounts have regularly and steadily repeated the deal at this same rate. You’re once again able to pick one up for your on-the-go kit with a $70 markdown at the best price we have tracked. If you want to save a little more, you can also find its 140W 20,000mAh variant down at <strong>$89 shipped</strong> right now, too. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/29/24000mah-sharge-170w-power-bank-99-low/#more-1171978\">more…</a>",

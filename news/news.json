Don’t forget to <em>clip the on-page coupon</em> to see the discounted price during checkout. That’s a straight-up $57 discount on its $200 usual going rate. This model saw its first big discount earlier this year in July when it dropped to the $150 mark, which it returned to several times since then, including during the recent Black Friday Week sale event. Today’s Cyber Monday deal, however, shaves an additional $7 off to mark a new best price to beat. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this webcam, and you can learn more about it below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/01/insta360-link-2-webcam-with-built-in-gimbal-143-all-time-low/#more-1180887\">more…</a>",

While it carries a $4,898 MSRP direct from the brand, the bagless package can often be found starting lower at $3,999 at Amazon, with discounts having taken costs as low as $1,799 before a former early Black Friday flash sale (also without a free bag) dropped things to $1,599 for the first time (costing you $1,698 total to add the bag there). The deal here provides you with the next-best price to date, giving you $2,200 off the going rate and $3,099 off the MSRP.

Coming down from $130 here, we saw this rate first appear back during July’s Prime Day event, with that rate repeating regularly in the time since. Whereas we’ve seen the same camera with a 32GB microSD card go a little lower in the past, this package with an even larger 128GB microSD card is landing back at its lowest tracked price with $45 cut from the tag and would make a great gift for any drivers you know who could use the added eyes for bolstered security/protection when the unexpected occurs. You can also shop the brand’s more advanced dash cam systems in its official storefront here. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/16/redtiger-f7np-front-rear-dash-cam-128gb-85-low/#more-1183947\">more…</a>",

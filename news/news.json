The base setup for this new system (the module and one battery) will carry a $5,799 full price once these launch discounts fade, but for folks who missed out on the pre-order offer, it’s still a solid $1,500 price cut alongside $1,346 in bundled items (a 400W solar panel, AC generator adapter cable, a 120V/240V power strip, and a metal pad) for a combined $2,846 in savings – and more for folks who did pre-order!

This older model usually keeps to its $549 full price, though we did see a large period of time of it keeping down at this same rate at Amazon from November through to the new year. Now, the deal is returning, giving you a $50 markdown to the lowest price we have tracked that I personally loved and recommend <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2024/09/04/review-whiskers-litter-robot-3-connect-is-a-must-have-for-cat-owners/\">following my original hands-on review</a> back in 2024.

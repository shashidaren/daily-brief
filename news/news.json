To start, one of the most notable collection of deals is on <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59271&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluettipower.com%2Fproducts%2Felite-400-portable-power-station\">Bluetti’s newest Elite 400 Portable Power Station that starts from <strong>$1,221.06 shipped</strong></a> for the standalone station,<em> after using the exclusive code <strong>9TO5TOYS6OFF </strong>that only works for this series at checkout. </em>Thanks to the extra savings, this deal even beats out its Amazon pricing by $78. While it is listed with a $2,699 MSRP, you’ll more often find it down at $1,899 on most given days, with the last (and only other) time we saw it come down this low being during the brand’s Christmas sale. Now, you’re getting a second chance at $678 off its going rate (and $1,478 off the MSRP), letting you add it to your traveling and at-home needs for the best price we have tracked in its history since hitting the market in November. Head below for more on this and three variant models that are our favorite picks for bolstered backup support from this brand – all starting from $379 with the codes. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/05/bluetti-elite-400-portable-power-station-exclusive-1221-low-more/#more-1191766\">more…</a>",

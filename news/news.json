While it carries an $1,899 MSRP since releasing in September, it launched and has been regularly dropped down to $1,099 in the time since when apart of sales, which is where Amazon currently has it priced, though you won’t be getting the FREE Trail 200 DC station with it (valued at $200). We’ve only seen this rate beaten by its $1,044 launch deal (with a bonus savings code), so you’re looking at the next-best price here, especially bundled with the extra power station, giving you a total $1,000 in savings. Head below to learn more about these and the other offers in this flash sale.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/17/ecoflow-delta-3-max-plus-free-trail-200-flash-sale-more/#more-1176677\">more…</a>",

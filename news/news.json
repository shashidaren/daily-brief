Of course, the biggest deals during this new event are on <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/nXkvj9\">Lectric’s XPedition 2 Cargo e-bikes</a>, with the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/RGRNdy\">standard 13Ah e-bike getting a $346 bundle at <strong>$1,399 shipped</strong></a>, while the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/7aMQAV\">26Ah dual-battery e-bike is getting a $545 bundle at <strong>$1,799 shipped</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/OeaxRN\">35Ah dual-battery long-range e-bike is seeing the $694 bundle at <strong>$1,999 shipped</strong></a>. Without the usual savings on the bundles themselves, as is common during Lectric’s sale events, you’d have to pay either $1,745, $2,344, or $2,693 for these same packages at full price. They may not be the largest bundles like we saw during Black Friday and the previous holiday sale events, but you’re still saving a significant amount – up to $693 – while also upgrading to one of America’s most popular cargo-hauling solutions.

It’s dropping down from its $210 full price, which we saw go as low as $150 in the first half of 2025, while the latter half has seen drops to $140, as well as the one-time previous fall to this same rate during Black Friday events two weeks ago. It’s coming back around for the second time here today, giving you $80 in savings to the best price that we have tracked. If you’re looking for something with a little more power, but still providing unique portability, the brand’s NB8 Ultra 4-gallon Cordless Pressure Washer is down at its second-lowest price of $199.99 shipped, too.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/11/fanttik-nb8-fold-ultra-cordless-electric-pressure-washers-from-130/#more-1182994\">more…</a>",

This particular model hit the scene earlier this year carrying a $100 price tag, and it has been fetching $81 at Amazon since its price dropped ahead of the Black Friday sale. Today’s deal at Woot slashes $30 off its usual going rate, landing it $10 below its previous all-time low to set a new best price to beat.

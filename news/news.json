Normally $239 when at full price, we saw this same rate pop up for a few days during last week’s Prime event, with the brand providing another opportunity here while the flash savings last. While we have seen the price go lower in the past, you’re looking at the best rate tracked since May, cutting $60 off the going rate and giving you a compact companion for powering devices while away from home or civilization.

These packages at full price would cost you $1,738 and $1,703 without the discounts on the bundled gear, which beats out both the Prime Day Sales’ bundle sizes from July and last week.

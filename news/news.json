This AMD-powered machine typically goes for $900, so you’re looking at a straight-up $300 discount on it today. This would be a great pick for anyone upgrading from an older notebook or buying their first gaming laptop, and it delivers some serious value today at its discounted price. We recently saw the <a href=\"https://howl.link/njuxfg5puois3\">Intel-powered variant of this notebook</a> go for less, but this one with a relatively newer, more powerful AMD Ryzen AI 5 240 AI processor has never been this low.

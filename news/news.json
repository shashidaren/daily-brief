It would normally cost you $100 at full price, with discounts having only beaten this rate once in 2025 during July’s Prime Day event, when it fell to the $64 low. Today’s deal comes in as a repeat from last month’s Prime Day, giving you a $30 markdown from the going rate for the second-lowest price we have tracked. You’ll also find the 99-foot model down at $89.99 shipped from $130, the 164-foot model at $149.99 shipped from $200, and the 328-foot model at $299.99 shipped from $400. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/06/govee-christmas-lights-2-with-matter-from-70/#more-1174088\">more…</a>",

This is originally a $150 unit that has fetched as much as $120 in recent months. It has lately been fetching $99, but it’s now seeing an additional discount that lands it $29 below its previous all-time low and our mention from August. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this mouse, and it’s a pretty good option to consider if you’re looking to grab a new one for your battlestation or get one as a gift. Alongside the black model, Amazon also has the Faker and Fortnite Editions of this mouse, though those versions aren’t seeing nearly as big a discount as the white one at the moment.

Jackery’s largest and most modular solution, the <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/qzDYZj\">Explorer 5000 Plus Portable Power Station is starting during this event at <strong>$2,849.05 shipped</strong></a>, with an extra 5% savings being added automatically in your cart (though if you don’t see it, be sure to use the code <strong>NEW5</strong>). It’s coming down off its $4,299 MSRP here, which is where Amazon currently has it priced at, and is dropping among some of the more common prices we see during sale events. While we have seen it go as low as $2,799 direct from the brand and $2,399 from a one-time exclusive deal we scored back in December from Wellbots, you’re still getting a solid $1,450 savings here that lands it down among some of the lowest prices we have tracked – $50 above the lowest price from the brand and $450 above the all-time low. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/02/jackery-super-bowl-sale-explorer-5000-plus-power-station-from-2849-more/#more-1191052\">more…</a>",

One unit I want to point out is <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/kODyWd\">Anker’s SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station at <strong><s>$1,899</s> $1,799 shipped</strong></a>, which matches the price we’re seeing at Amazon, though be sure to clip the on-page 5% off coupon. It may have a $3,999 MSRP direct from the brand, but at Amazon you can find it starting between $2,399 and $2,599. It’s mostly been keeping above $2,000 since December, which is when we saw the $1,799 low from Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales rise in price. You’re looking at the next-best rate today that even beats out the previous New Year sale by $100, with $700 struck from the going rate ($2,100 off the MSRP), making this quite the surprise offer.

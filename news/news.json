One unit I want to point out is <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/kODyWd\">Anker’s SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station at <strong><s>$1,899</s> $1,799 shipped</strong></a>, which matches the price we’re seeing at Amazon, though be sure to clip the on-page 5% off coupon. It may have a $3,999 MSRP direct from the brand, but at Amazon you can find it starting between $2,399 and $2,599. It’s mostly been keeping above $2,000 since December, which is when we saw the $1,799 low from Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales rise in price. You’re looking at the next-best rate today that even beats out the previous New Year sale by $100, with $700 struck from the going rate ($2,100 off the MSRP), making this quite the surprise offer.

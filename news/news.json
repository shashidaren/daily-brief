Coming down from their $1,800 and $2,000 MSRPs, we’ve mostly seen these models over the last year keeping between $1,300 and $1,400 for the E15 robot, while the E18 robot has kept between $1,500 and $1,600. Now, you’re able to grab them at the lowest prices we have tracked to date, courtesy of the $800 and $600 savings during this event. On their direct website pages, there are also bundle options to score blade replacement kits, as well. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/09/anker-eufy-e15-e18-robot-lawn-mowers-new-lows-from-1000/#more-1192267\">more…</a>",

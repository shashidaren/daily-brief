This is a newer mower amongst the lineup, which is coming down off its usual $450 tag for a lower price than we normally see, with things having mostly kept above $360 over the year. Things finally dropped lower for the first time during July’s Prime Day, when costs were taken down to $328, with today’s deal only beaten out by the $273 low that popped up for a short time last month. If you missed out there, you can get it here at the next-best rate, which cuts $135 off the tag and gives you a more advanced electric mowing solution.

One notable price cut during this event is on the newest <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EGO-ZT5207L-Lithium-ion-Cordless-Batteries/dp/B0BQQ1HCX6/ref=ast_sto_dp_puis?tag=toysrein-20\">EGO Z6 52-inch Cordless Electric Zero-Turn Riding Lawn Mower</a> with six 12.0Ah batteries for $5,599.99 shipped.

The deal here provides a 20% markdown off the going rate, slashing $1,399 off the tag for the third-lowest price we have tracked. You can also find a large number of other tools seeing discounts in the brand’s official storefront here, with the best of them collected together below. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/08/52-inch-ego-z6-cordless-zero-turn-riding-mower-5600-more/#more-1166636\">more…</a>",

We saw this one drop to $110 last month, but today’s deal at Amazon shaves an additional $10 off its usual going rate to mark the best price we have tracked for it to date. What’s particularly worth noting here is that the Amazon listing includes a folio case for just $5 more than <a href=\"https://howl.link/42fp26ccgx8ys\">Lenovo’s current offer of <strong>$94.99 shipped</strong></a> (with promo code <strong>EXTRAFIVE</strong>) for just the tablet alone without the case.

This is the base model from Microsoft’s latest portable Xbox lineup, which launched at $600 only a few months ago, and today’s $110 price cut marks the lowest price we’ve tracked for it to date. It comes in $10 under the previous all-time low we saw briefly at <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/aOJO5N\">Best Buy</a> during its Black Friday sale. It’s not often that a new, Xbox-branded gaming console sees such a steep discount this early, so you might want to jump on this offer if you’ve been eyeing a new handheld for the holidays. Amazon’s listing also includes 3 months of Game Pass Premium for free, making this an even better deal overall.

Amazon is currently offering LG’s 2025 UltraGear 27-inch QHD 300Hz IPS gaming display for $266.99 shipped. This particular model hit the scene earlier this year carrying a $450 price tag, so you’re looking at a straight-up $183 markdown on it right now. It dropped to $315 last month during the fall Prime Day sale, but today’s 41% offer beats that with an additional $48 discount to mark a new best price to beat.

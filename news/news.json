It carries a $4,799 MSRP directly from the brand, but more often can be scored down around the $3,899 when at full price at Amazon. Discounts over the year have mostly dropped costs further to $2,799, with some occasional dips lower to $2,699 and $2,599, the latter of which was only seen a few weeks ago during the Prime Day event. You’re looking at another chance to pick it up at its Prime Day low, saving you $1,300 off the going rate and $2,200 off the MSRP for the best price we have tracked. Head below to check out the full lineup of deals for this model. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/22/anker-solix-f3800-plus-power-station-from-2599-low-more/#more-1170461\">more…</a>",

This black variant hit the scene last month carrying a $94 price tag, and it’s now seeing a 15% markdown. Today’s deal shaves $14 off its usual going rate, marking the return of the lowest price it first hit during the fall Prime Day sale earlier this month. We’ve seen the standard grey variant go for less at $76, and the newly launched black one is now within $4 of that price. Similarly, the 100W black variant is currently on sale for $61.19 shipped, down from $72, and sitting within $3 of the lowest price we’ve seen for the grey model.

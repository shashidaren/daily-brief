This package would fetch you $1,898 without any discounts, and hasn’t been featured like this in past sales, instead being split into two separate bundles. Considering the expanded setup has gone as low as $699, and the water-resistant bag on its own has gone as low as $80 (meaning $779 total with their best pricing), this bundle with all three certainly seems to be the lowest price you could score them with, complete with $1,169 savings.

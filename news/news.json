With the success the brand has been having since last year’s reveal of the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=93539&amp;awinaffid=1642421&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.segway.com%2Febike\"><strong>Xafari</strong> and <strong>Xyber</strong> e-bikes</a>, it’s no surprise that the popular brand is further expanding its newest series of commuting solutions. Two of these new e-bikes are aiming to not only fill the broad accessibility space of its previous models, but also further integrate and improve Segway’s already impressive lineup of smart tech, while the third of these models comes as an even higher-end adrenaline rush for off-roading thrill seekers. Release dates are staggered, with one of the e-bikes already available for purchase, while the other two (and the accessories) are going to be released across spring and summer. Head below to get the full rundown on what to expect. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/06/segway-unveils-the-myon-and-muxi-e-bikes-and-the-xaber-300-electric-dirt-bike-at-ces-2026/#more-1186360\">more…</a>",

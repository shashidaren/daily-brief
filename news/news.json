This notebook hit the scene earlier this year March carrying an $850 price tag and held steady until recently, when it started seeing some price drops. It dipped to $700 for the first time in August, and today’s deal steps it up with an extra $50 off. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this model, and it’s now fetching $15 less than its previous all-time low from the recent fall Prime Day sale.

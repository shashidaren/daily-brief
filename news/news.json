You can get this in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C61JLDQZ?tag=karthikl-20&amp;th=1\">black</a> and silver finishes, and they’re both down to $39.50 today. This is originally a $90 USB-C hub that has lately been fetching $60 at Amazon via the brand’s official storefront. By entering the promo code, however, you can save an additional $20 off its usual going rate right now. This particular hub dropped to $48 during the recent Prime Day sale, and today’s deal lands it $8 below that price to mark the lowest price we have tracked for it.

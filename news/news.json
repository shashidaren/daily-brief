This is regularly a $1,600 notebook, which is now seeing a straight-up $500 discount. We’ve seen a few Galaxy Book5 variants get discounted here and there since Black Friday, but this specific model has largely been away from the spotlight. In fact, the last notable deal we saw for this model was during last year’s fall Prime Day sale, when it briefly dropped to $1,100. Today’s offer shaves $400 off its usual going rate to mark the return of that all-time low. Amazon also has the 32GB RAM/1TB SSD variant of this laptop at <strong>$1,499.99 shipped</strong>, whereas Samsung is offering the <a href=\"https://howl.link/z5t04eptszjka\">16GB/1TB variant for <strong>$1,299.99 shipped</strong></a> with a $400 discount.

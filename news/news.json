Don’t forget to <em>clip the on-page coupon</em> to see the discounted price during checkout. This is originally a $70 combo that has lately been sitting at the $67 mark. Today’s deal shaves a solid $17 off its usual going rate to mark the lowest price we have tracked for it – essentially bringing the cost down to what you’d normally pay for the keyboard alone. We saw this combo in Lilac drop to the $52 mark earlier this year in April, but today’s beats that by an additional $2 discount. The same combo in off white is also down to <strong>$50.36 shipped</strong> with the <em>on-page coupon</em>, though the other variants are all fetching their full prices.

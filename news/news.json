While it carries a $999 MSRP, we’ve been seeing it in 2025 keep down at $699 in full at Amazon. Since the end of July it’s been staying above $549, with past discounts this year having taken the costs as low as $379 in a series of short-term Lightning sales back at the top of the year. You’re looking at a 29% markdown off the going rate here, which saves you $200 while equipping your outdoor adventures with the means to keep your personal devices running.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/08/28/dji-power-1000-or-2000-power-stations-from-499/#more-1156671\">more…</a>",

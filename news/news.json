Many of the previous deals with up to $893 bundle savings are available, though two of the three models with price cuts have returned to their usual bundle pricing, like the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/LKrDAa\">XPeak 2.0 Long-Range Off-Road e-bike and a FREE $583 accessory package at <strong>$1,699 shipped</strong></a>. You can also find the standard <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/R5VKya\">XPeak 2.0 e-bike with a FREE $434 bundle at <strong>$1,499 shipped</strong></a>. These bundles with their e-bikes would normally run you $2,282 and $1,933 at full price, which is not only bringing back Black Friday’s same offers, but also gives you another shot at the largest bundles we’ve seen to date.

While this is a versatile robot for in-ground of above-ground pools, folks with above-ground swimming holes can save a bit more by going with the Scuba SE Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner at <strong>$139.99 shipped</strong>, which has been serving my brother well for over a year now. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/02/aiper-scuba-s1-robot-pool-cleaner-480/#more-1186000\">more…</a>",

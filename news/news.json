This upgraded sidecar model hit the scene at the end of 2024 with a $3,899 full price, which is where it kept for most of 2025, though discounts in the early months, November, and December saw discounts drop costs to $3,509 and the $3,499 low. There’s no telling when we’ll see discounts offered again in 2026, so its a prime time to jump on the $400 markdown to the lowest price we have tracked before the event ends with January 15. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/14/mod-easy-sidecar-sahara-e-bike-3499-low-400-off/#more-1187803\">more…</a>",

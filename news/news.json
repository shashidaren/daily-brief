Of course, across all your options from this brand, my personal pick for holiday scores is the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/MAg9MN\">XP4 Folding Utility e-bike with $227 in FREE gear at <strong>$999 shipped</strong></a> or the <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/e1a6LZ\">XP4 750 Folding Utility e-bikes with $514 in FREE gear at <strong>$1,299 shipped</strong></a>. Without the usual discounts on the bundles themselves, you’d be paying $1,226 and $1,813 for these packages at full price, with the standard models seeing a shrunk-down bundle that still beats the usual $79 package we’ve mostly seen over 2025, and the 750 model continuing over its previous bundle size which has been the largest we’ve seen since it released in early summer. Head below to browse the full lineup of deals across all models from this brand – and you have until December 15 to get orders in to receive them ahead of Christmas. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/08/lectric-christmas-holiday-sale-893-savings-e-bike-bundles-from-999/#more-1182263\">more…</a>",

This particular model hit the scene ahead of Black Friday last year carrying a $50 price tag, and has mostly stayed there until recently when they started seeing some discounts. Some of these keyboards dropped to the $35 mark earlier this year in October, but today’s deal shaves an additional $2 off to mark a new best price to beat.

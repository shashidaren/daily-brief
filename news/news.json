While it sports a $170 MSRP, you’ll more regularly find it floating around $130 at full price since its newer third-generation model released, with discounts having gone as low as $95 over the year, which last popped up back during July’s Prime Day event. Last week’s Prime Big Deal Days event kept things at $100, but now you can score it back at the annual low for the second time ever. The deal gives you a 27% markdown off the going rate (44% off the MSRP), cutting $35 from the tag here, and saving you a total $75 off the MSRP that you would pay elsewhere, for another shot at the best price of 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/13/marshall-emberton-ii-portable-bluetooth-speaker-95/#more-1168493\">more…</a>",

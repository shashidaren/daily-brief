You’ll currently find a single of these e-bikes at its lowest $1,299 pricing right now during this sale, which normally goes for $1,699 at full price – meaning this bundle would normally fetch $3,398 without any discounts. What makes this deal especially nice – aside from being able to ride with your loved on on separate e-bikes – is that with its current pricing, they come out to be $999 each. That’s $300 less per e-bike than you’ve ever been able to score on a single model, and happens to be the best price we have tracked for two of them to date.

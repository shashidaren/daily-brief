While normally fetching $470 at full price these days, we’ve mostly seen this package keeping between $390 and $350 over the year, with some falls as low as $300, the only two of which happened during both July and October’s Prime Day events. This deal also beats out the one-day-only Target offer on the V8 Origin package, giving you more accessory attachments at the lowest tracked price that hasn’t been seen since Cyber Monday sales in 2024.

It would normally run you $5,199 for everything (including the $99 bag), with the bagless bundle at Amazon keeping lower at a starting rate of $3,999 and only dropping to $1,999 right now. This deal comes in $100 under its previous offer during the brand’s Halloween Sale, giving you a total $2,300 off the going rate ($3,500 off the MSRP) for the best new price that we have tracked anywhere.

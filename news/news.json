This particular set of the brand’s latest lavalier microphone with two transmitters, one receiver, and charging case typically goes for $330, so you’re looking at a straight-up $70 discount on it today. The Mic 3 is the brand’s new release that hit the scene in August, and today’s deal lands as its first discount. Deals on DJI products have been hard to come by lately thanks to spotty stock across retailers – even Amazon mostly shows third-party listings like this one for the Mic 3 set at $259. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this set to date, so you might want to jump in there quickly before it sells out.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/09/first-deal-dji-latest-mic-3-complete-set-all-time-low/#more-1182581\">more…</a>",

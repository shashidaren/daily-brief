It carries a $500 MSRP, but has been hanging down at $450 since late October, which was also when we last saw the price drop down to this all-time low rate. You’re getting a second chance at this $200 total markdown here, which comes in just $16 above the current pricing of its e-bike-compatible variant that only sports a 150-pound payload over this model’s 200-pound payload.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/04/bougerv-e-bike-rack-300-low/#more-1173471\">more…</a>",

Down from its $209 full price, since December, it’s regularly been keeping to this same rate, with only a few spikes back up to its full rate in that timeframe. We don’t normally see this model discounted directly from the brand’s site, with Amazon instead giving you the chance to pick it up at the second-lowest price we have tracked – just $7 above the one-time low that hasn’t reappeared since Black Friday. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/256wh-jackery-explorer-240d-power-station-139/#more-1192648\">more…</a>",

Today’s deal takes $250 off its listed rate, landing it $100 below its previous all-time low and our mention from earlier this year. The SteamOS-powered variant of the Legion Go is rarely discounted, so the fact that it’s now going for even less than its original $500 launch price makes this an excellent offer if you are in the market to buy a new handheld. The more powerful 32GB RAM/1TB SSD model of the <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/GK9DWn\">Legion Go S is also down to <strong>$649.99 shipped</strong></a>, which is $130 less than its previous all-time low.

If you didn’t jump on any of the previous deals last month or for Cyber Monday, it’s a prime opportunity to score <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/6yaNam\">Anker’s SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station at <strong>$1,998.95 shipped</strong></a>, which also matches the price we’re seeing over at Amazon. It carries a $3,999 MSRP direct from the brand, and while we occasionally see Amazon pricing pop up to that rate, it can more often be scored between $2,699 and $2,299 these days. We first saw this price appear during early Black Friday sales before dipping to the $1,799 low through Cyber Monday and climbing back to $2,400 after. Now, you’re getting a second opportunity to get $700 off the going rate (and $2,000 off the MSRP) for the second-best price behind that one-time low. You can also save a bit more by jumping on the <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/10/refurbished-anker-solix-f3800-power-station-exclusive-new-1399-low/\">exclusive deal for a refurbished F3800 station</a> that we secured recently.

While it carries a $170 MSRP, it’s coming down from its more recent $142 rate that it’s been holding to in the new year, beating out all the prior discounts we’ve seen since July 2025. Considering that the Greenworks dethatcher/scarifier is only available in a $150 used condition, while Sun Joe’s model has been keeping to its full $160 price since mid-December, this is certainly the most affordable option for brand-new equipment that gives you budget-friendly functionality.

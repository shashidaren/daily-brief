One notable expanded package is the <a href=\"https://velotricebike.pxf.io/xLWxXy\">Velotric T1 ST Plus Lightweight Urban e-bike</a>, coming with a FREE range extender battery ($400 value) for <strong><a href=\"https://velotricebike.pxf.io/xLWxXy\">$1,299 shipped</a></strong>. You’d have to pay $1,649 for the e-bike on its own without any discounts, with that extra battery running that price up to $2,049. The brand’s early Black Friday deal only offered $350 savings (with the bundle being a rear cargo rack), but for this short-term change-up, you’re getting $750 in total savings that returns the tag to the lowest price we have tracked in 2025.

Alternatively, you can even get this 6-port charger for <strong>FREE</strong> when you buy the brand’s 140W 5-in-1 Nomos charging station with a Qi2-certified wireless charger. Simply head to this link right here and add both the 140W and 120W units from the “Qualifying” and “Benefit” sections to your cart and checkout. This charging unit is good to have on our desk for powering multiple devices simultaneously, and you can learn more about it in detail below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/15/120w-baseus-charging-station-at-30-low/#more-1168954\">more…</a>",

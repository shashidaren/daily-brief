We previously saw the standard MX Master 4 and the MX Master 4 Business variants briefly drop in price, but this is the first time we’re seeing this unit in Space Black and White Silver colorways see a discount. Although it’s not a huge markdown, it’s still a notable one considering this is Logitech’s flagship mouse that’s only been out for a couple of months now. The mouse is currently fetching its full $120 price directly at <a href=\"https://logitech.cfzu.net/mOWVb7\">Logitech</a>, but you get to pick between some freebies including <a href=\"https://logitech.cfzu.net/mOWVb7\">a Logitech Studio series DESK MAT</a> that’ll pair nicely with the mouse.

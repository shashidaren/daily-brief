It’s coming down from a $1,299 MSRP, which surprisingly starts higher from $1,399 at Amazon. Since debuting and launching from CES 2026 with a discount to $899, we saw that same price cut repeat later in January, before spending most of the time since dropping to $999. Now, you’re getting a 27% markdown that cuts $350 off the going rate for the second-lowest price we have tracked. On the same page, you can find a bundle option giving you the <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/ra9xd3\">power station with two 200W solar panels for <strong>$1,499 shipped</strong></a>, which is the same low we saw launch with the standalone unit at CES 2026. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/16/jackery-explorer-1500-ultra-power-station-949/#more-1193457\">more…</a>",

Down from its full $420 price tag, this is a repeat of the same deal we spied last month, which comes in $1 lower than Black Friday and Christmas rates. You’re looking at a 24% markdown off the going rate, giving you $100 savings to the all-time lowest price we have tracked. For alternate options, you can find a collection of the brand’s other e-scooters benefiting from discounts on the official Amazon storefront page here. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/20/gotrax-xr-elite-max-e-scooter-320-low-100-off/#more-1194506\">more…</a>",

We’ve seen it previously dip to $20 a few times, but today’s deal takes an extra $2 off, marking the lowest price we’ve tracked for it so far. This slim tracking card is a good option to consider if you’re like me and don’t love the idea of stuffing an AirTag into your wallet and adding unnecessary bulk.

On paper, it sticks to a familiar 68-key layout, but the design is quite different, and it brings a few thoughtful additions that make it genuinely interesting. I’ve been using the Flow 2 wireless low-profile keyboard as my main board for the past few months, and it’s one I keep coming back to, even with several other keyboards sitting on my desk.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/25/review-lofree-flow-2-low-profile-aluminum-wireless-keyboard/#more-1195179\">more…</a>",

While you may find it carrying a $1,580 MSRP direct from the brand, it more often can be found down around $1,100, with most of the discounts we’ve seen in 2026 so far being falls to $900, though there have been dips lower to this same rate, too. You’re getting another shot at this lower-than-average price, which comes from the $220 markdown off the going rate (and $700 off the MSRP), landing things at the second-best price we have tracked over the last year – just $44 above the yearly low that appeared during Black Friday and $80 above the all-time low we last saw in 2024.

This bundle, usually priced at $200, includes two of our favorite Mac accessories – the MX Keys S keyboard and the MX Master 3S mouse. The keyboard typically sells for $130 and the mouse for $110 on their own, so this bundle saves you a solid $85. We first saw this combo drop to $155 on Amazon last month, but it didn’t stay there for long. Today’s offer marks the return of that price, giving you another shot if you missed it the first time.

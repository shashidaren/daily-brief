Alongside the low prices we spotted on the <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/09/anker-solix-everfrost-2-electric-coolers-from-599/\">EverFrost 2 electric coolers</a>, as well as the launch deals on the <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/08/anker-solix-c1000-gen-2-power-station-launch-from-429/\">new C1000 Gen 2 station</a>, we also noticed the brand’s other recent release, the <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/APeyGR\">SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station dropping to <strong>$1,649 shipped</strong></a> during this sale, which sits $1 under Amazon’s pricing. It fetches $2,599 at full price, with discounts having mostly gone as low as $1,699, unless the sales offered bonus savings that saw the cost drop to $1,614 or the one-time $1,599 rate we saw during Prime Day. The deal here is the third-best we have tracked, saving you $950 off the going rate and bringing you one of the latest, upgraded backup power solutions from the Anker flag. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/10/anker-solix-fan-fest-sale-starting-from-120/#more-1159570\">more…</a>",

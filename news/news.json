Going for $310 at full price, we’ve mostly seen it hanging down around $250 during the last few months of holidays, with occasional dips to $240 and the first appearance of this same rate post-Cyber Monday, followed by its second appearance as a more short-term Lightning deal. Now, you’re getting a third chance to score it at the best price we have tracked over the last year, thanks to the return of this $74 markdown, making it a more budget-friendly model than its newer dual-zone and wheeled counterpart that is sitting $114 higher, which does still come in lower than some premium brand models. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/23/bougerv-53-quart-portable-fridge-freezer-at-236/#more-1189238\">more…</a>",

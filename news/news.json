This is regularly a $50 unit, which is now seeing a 28% markdown. Today’s deal shaves $14 off its usual going rate, marking the return of the lowest price it first hit shortly after its debut last year. Discounts on this charger have been few and far between – it didn’t even receive a meaningful cut during Black Friday – so this deal is particularly worth considering if you’ve been eyeing a new charger. You can also get this in black and white colors, and they’re both down to the $36 low today.

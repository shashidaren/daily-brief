This is regularly a $550 model, which is now seeing a solid $180 discount. It dropped to the $400 mark last month during the fall Prime Day sale, but today’s Black Friday offer steps it up with an additional $30 discount. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this gaming display, and it’s also one of the best prices we have tracked for a QD-OLED gaming monitor yet, as these displays typically cost close to $1,000, like this <a href=\"https://howl.link/0t4syv891dk3s\">wildly popular Alienware QD-OLED monitor</a> that’s currently going for <a href=\"https://howl.link/0t4syv891dk3s\"><strong>$699.99 shipped</strong></a> after a $200 discount. Also, a similarly-specced AOC model with a different part number is currently fetching $399.99 shipped at Amazon, making Best Buy’s a touch better in terms of the overall value.

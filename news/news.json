This is originally a $150 unit that has fetched as much as $120 in recent months. It has lately been fetching $99, but it’s now seeing an additional discount that lands it $29 below its previous all-time low and our mention from August. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this mouse, and it’s a pretty good option to consider if you’re looking to grab a new one for your battlestation or get one as a gift. Alongside the black model, Amazon also has the Faker and Fortnite Editions of this mouse, though those versions aren’t seeing nearly as big a discount as the white one at the moment.

Today’s deal marks the return of the Black Friday price we tracked for this battery pack last month, making this a great time to cash in and snag one for yourself or as a last-minute gift – you can get it before Christmas. Only once before today have we seen this unit go for anything less than today’s discounted price when it briefly dropped at Newegg, and it’s now within $6 of that.

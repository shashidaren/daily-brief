After months of rumors of an official, proper Direct showcase, it is finally on the slate. Nintendo has been cranking these things out faster and more frequent than ever since Switch 2 hit store shelves, but they have largely come in the form of dedicated showcases for specific titles and those Direct side quests: IndieWorld and Partner Showcase. This week though, we get the real deal. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/10/nintendo-direct-switch-2-mario-40/#more-1159741\">more…</a>",

Among the group, we spotted a notably large bundle being given to Lectric’s <a href=\"https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/kOEWb3\">XPress 750 Long-Range Commuter e-bikes that are getting $424 in FREE gear at <strong>$1,299 shipped</strong></a>, in both its step-thru and step-over designs. This package would normally run you $1,723 without the bundle savings, which beats out all the bundles we’ve seen before that only ever amounted up to $410 in gear. Along with the e-bike (which is one of my favorite commuters over the years), you’ll be getting a rear cargo rack, fenders to go over both tires, an Elite headlight upgrade, a suspension seat post, two adjustable rear-view mirrors, and an accordion-style folding bike lock. Head below for more on this e-bike’s capabilities and the other deals we’re seeing while the sale lasts. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/10/lectric-endless-summer-sale-424-bundle-xpress-750-1299-more/#more-1159724\">more…</a>",

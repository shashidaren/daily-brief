Amazon currently has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1NHSFMF?tag=karthikl-20\">Lenovo’s latest 2025 Tab One Android tablet with folio case down at <strong>$99.99 shipped</strong></a>. This particular unit debuted earlier this year carrying a $160 price tag, and it’s now seeing a $60 discount. We saw this one drop to $110 last month, but today’s deal at Amazon shaves an additional $10 off its usual going rate to mark the best price we have tracked for it to date. What’s particularly worth noting here is that the Amazon listing includes a folio case for just $5 more than <a href=\"https://howl.link/42fp26ccgx8ys\">Lenovo’s current offer of <strong>$94.99 shipped</strong></a> (with promo code <strong>EXTRAFIVE</strong>) for just the tablet alone without the case.

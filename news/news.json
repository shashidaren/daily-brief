These new outdoor ambient lights hit the market back at the end of September, and would normally fetch $540 at full price, though they’ve been keeping down at $459 since mid-October after rising from the previous fall to this same rate. Today’s deal gives you another shot at the best price we have tracked, letting you upgrade your outdoor lighting with $110 in total savings. You can also find its 200-foot model down at the second-lowest price of $729.99 shipped, from $860.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/12/govee-permanent-outdoor-lights-prism-from-430-low/#more-1175424\">more…</a>",

This particular model hit the scene earlier this year carrying a $290 price tag, and this unit here without the included Lenovo Pen typically goes for $270. It dropped to $200 earlier this month before quickly bouncing back up, but it’s now seeing an additional $10 off. That makes this the lowest price we’ve seen yet for this tablet, so be sure to snag it while the deal lasts.

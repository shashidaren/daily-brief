You’d usually be shelling out $500 for this speaker at full price, which has been regularly spending time down at $400 throughout 2025. We did spot it dropping to $360 and $340 last month in Prime-exclusive deals, though if you missed out on those rates, you can pick it up today at the same price we saw during July’s Prime Day event.

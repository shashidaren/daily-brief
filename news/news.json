This model typically sells for $100 but is now available at a hefty 40% discount. Today’s deal takes $40 off its usual price, marking the return of the best price we’ve seen yet – and $6 less than what it’s currently listed for at Amazon. One thing to note, though, is that Best Buy’s listing doesn’t mention the 240W braided cable that comes bundled when you buy from Amazon.

A standout, though, is the flash offer lasting only through the weekend on the latest <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/PO9ZQz\">HomePower 3000 Portable Power Station at <strong>$1,499 shipped</strong></a>, which comes in a little under Amazon by $4. Since its release back in May, we’ve seen it brought down from its full $2,499 price tag to land between $1,899 and $1,699 during sales, with Amazon seeing it drop to $1,599 for the first time today (while the on-page coupon there takes things lower) and the brand’s direct site taking things under $1,500 for the first time while these flash savings last, giving you $1,000 in savings at the best new price we have tracked. The bundle on <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/Z61DW1\">this station and two 200W solar panels</a> is also at a new low of <a href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/Z61DW1\"><strong>$1,799 shipped</strong></a>, landing $100 under the previous low and $5 under Amazon’s current pricing.  </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/05/jackery-homepower-3000-station-and-bundle-from-1499/#more-1158390\">more…</a>",

It dropped a touch lower as part of a short-lived Holiday Sale deal at Dell last month, and today’s deal at Best Buy lands it within $50 of that price. <a href=\"https://howl.link/e7y8wykwna2cb\">Dell has other configs</a> of this notebook on sale right now, but this one’s fetching its full price there at $2,100. It’s a good option to pick if you’re looking to buy a new gaming laptop with more memory and storage headroom than what the base variants offer, and you can learn more about it in detail below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/13/alienware-aurora-16x-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-400-off-today/#more-1175925\">more…</a>",

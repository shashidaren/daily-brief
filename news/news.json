This unit has gone for as much as $150 in recent months, though it’s been hovering around $105 at Amazon lately. Today’s 47% discount knocks $70 off the list price, putting it $25 below its usual going rate. It’s also $10 cheaper than the previous all-time low of $90 we recently saw at Woot.

Among the new lineup, we spotted <a href=\"https://ecoflowtechnologyinc.pxf.io/6y46ME\">EcoFlow’s DELTA Pro Portable Power Station bundled with 2x 220W solar panels and a FREE protective bag at <strong>$1,699 shipped</strong></a>, which is not only being exclusively offered direct from the brand, but is also dropping things lower than ever. One thing to note here is that, sadly, the extra savings code isn’t valid on this bundle. It would normally run you $5,199 for everything (including the $99 bag), with the bagless bundle at Amazon keeping lower at a starting rate of $3,999 and only dropping to $1,999 right now. This deal comes in $100 under its previous offer during the brand’s Halloween Sale, giving you a total $2,300 off the going rate ($3,500 off the MSRP) for the best new price that we have tracked anywhere.

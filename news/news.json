You’ll currently find a single of these e-bikes at its lowest $1,299 pricing right now during this sale, which normally goes for $1,699 at full price – meaning this bundle would normally fetch $3,398 without any discounts. What makes this deal especially nice – aside from being able to ride with your loved on on separate e-bikes – is that with its current pricing, they come out to be $999 each. That’s $300 less per e-bike than you’ve ever been able to score on a single model, and happens to be the best price we have tracked for two of them to date. Head below to learn more about it and the other models benefiting from bundled savings. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/05/heybike-valentines-day-two-alpha-e-bikes-999-each-more/#more-1191775\">more…</a>",

The mid-tier option in this lineup is <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/2aPPNQ\">Anker’s SOLIX C2000 Gen 2 Portable Power Station at <strong>$779 shipped</strong></a>, and you’ll get a free tote bag, which also matches the pricing over at the brand’s Amazon storefront (without the bag).

While the price has gone a little lower in the past, with the all-time low having last appeared in November, you’re still getting a solid 48% markdown here that cuts $719 off the tag for the third-best price we have tracked – just $100 above the Black Friday low.

That’s a straight $600 off its $2,950 usual going rate, making this one of the lowest prices we’ve tracked so far. It’s only dipped lower once before, and today’s deal is just $50 shy of that all-time low. It’s an easy recommendation at this price, and it’s a particularly good deal considering <a href=\"https://howl.link/so6772wzh66qo\">Dell</a> is currently charging the same $2,350 for a lower-spec variant with an Ultra 7 processor and RTX 5060 GPU at its online store. There’s plenty to like about this machine, and you can learn more about it in detail below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/17/alienware-18-inch-area-51-rtx-5070-300hz-gaming-laptop-600-off/#more-1193666\">more…</a>",

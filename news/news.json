You can score the VIOFO A229 Ultra Dual-Channel 4K Dash Cam at $339.99 shipped, <em>after clipping the on-page coupon</em>, while the VIOFO A229 Ultra Three-Channel 4K Dash Cam drops to $369.99 shipped, <em>after clipping its on-page coupon</em>. What’s more, both systems come with the added perk of getting a FREE 256GB microSD card too ($50 value)! You’d normally be spending $390 or $440 for these models at full price, with this being the first cash savings we’ve spotted since they released at the top of August. All-in-all, you’re getting $50 and $70 price cuts here, along with the FREE $50 microSD card, which sets the bar for future discounts down the road, officially putting its time keeping to its MSRP in the rearview mirror. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/27/viofo-a229-ultra-dash-cams-first-savings-free-microsd-from-340/#more-1171534\">more…</a>",

Normally going for $1,899 in full, we’ve mostly been seeing the price taken down to $1,599 since March due to tariff hikes, with occasional falls lower to $1,499 for short timeframes. While we have seen it go lower in the past pre-tariff market, the deal here is a solid $400 price cut lending to a total $518 in savings ($672 if you add the Power Bank) that is the best price we’ve seen in our post-tariff market. You can also score an additional $150 off when buying two e-bikes together, with the usual medical provider, first responder, teacher, or military member discounts available too. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/27/early-black-friday-tenways-e-bike-from-1499/#more-1171516\">more…</a>",

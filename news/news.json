Originally priced at $2,500, this stunning curved gaming monitor has recently been selling for around $2,300. However, today’s Samsung deal – which includes a <a href=\"https://howl.link/7k3frnrjfeqgp\"><strong>$50</strong> upgrade credit</a> – knocks a full $850 off its regular price, bringing it down to one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for this model. This marks the return of the lowest price we’ve seen for this display all year, coming in $50 cheaper than the current discounts at Amazon, <a href=\"https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/4GvW19\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://bhpho.to/4mkYdD4\">B&amp;H</a>. That extra $50 in savings could easily go toward another accessory for your gaming setup, so be sure to cash in now after getting more details below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/15/samsung-57-inch-odyssey-neo-g9-monitor-lowest-price-of-the-year/#more-1168898\">more…</a>",

Don’t forget to <em>clip the on-page coupon</em> to see the discounted price during checkout. This is originally a $70 combo that has lately been sitting at the $67 mark. Today’s deal shaves a solid $17 off its usual going rate to mark the lowest price we have tracked for it – essentially bringing the cost down to what you’d normally pay for the keyboard alone. We saw this combo in Lilac drop to the $52 mark earlier this year in April, but today’s beats that by an additional $2 discount. The same combo in off white is also down to <strong>$50.36 shipped</strong> with the <em>on-page coupon</em>, though the other variants are all fetching their full prices.

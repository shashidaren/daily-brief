Today’s deal shaves $14 off its usual going rate, marking the return of the lowest price it first hit during the fall Prime Day sale earlier this month. We’ve seen the standard grey variant go for less at $76, and the newly launched black one is now within $4 of that price. Similarly, the 100W black variant is currently on sale for $61.19 shipped, down from $72, and sitting within $3 of the lowest price we’ve seen for the grey model.

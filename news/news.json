This is regularly a $420 display, which is currently fetching $400 at <a href=\"https://howl.link/gd22gbrsrmx16\">Samsung’s online store</a>. Today’s 52% discount at Amazon shaves $220 off its usual going rate, $200 below Samsung’s price. This is one of the lowest prices we have tracked for this display, and it’s now within $30 of its all-time low from when it hit $170 around the same time last year. It’s a pretty good option to consider if you’re looking to pick up a 4K monitor for your workstation, and you can learn more about it below.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/14/samsung-27-inch-4k-uhd-monitor-52-off/#more-1187821\">more…</a>",

      "link": "https://news.techmeme.com/251201/contact",
      "summary": "<p>Given that our contact points have evolved over the years, here's a general update on how best to tip us, advise us, or complain to us about news. This post is organized around several scenarios, which I'll list in bold. </p> <p><b>You want to send an announcement just as an FYI to Techmeme:</b> In the typical scenario, in which you think Techmeme is unlikely to feature the news, or you're not familiar with our criteria for posting, it's best not to do anything. Techmeme only posts about 50 headlines per day and any given announcement is very unlikely to be featured. So save us both time and focus on more fruitful channels than Techmeme. </p> <p><b>You want to send news to Techmeme that you think there's a good chance we'll want to post:</b> If you're familiar with Techmeme and anticipate we'll be interested in the story, you can tip the link using <a href=\"https://techmeme.com/tip\">this online form</a>. This form integrates into editors' workflow so human editors will see the link in real time. As a bonus, the form requests an email address, enabling us to notify you if we do post the link. For the (hopefully rare) bad actor out there, I need to stress that all submissions are fully vetted by human editors, so any spamming attempt will silently fail. </p> <p><b>You want to add a social link underneath news that is already featured on Techmeme:</b> We often feature related blog posts and social posts from LinkedIn, X, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon beneath our headlines, and you are encouraged to contribute these links. Just hover over the headline on our desktop page and click the \"Add Link Here\" button that appears. (For an example, see the image below.) As long as the link you submit adds value in some way, we will add it, and you'll get an email confirming this once we do. Feel free to tip your own links or links from your company, clients, or friends. As long as the link makes Techmeme better, it's a win/win for you and us. (Once again, I must stress that for the rare bad actor, all submissions are fully vetted, and spammy links will not make it to Techmeme.) </p> <img src=\"https://news.techmeme.com/images/add_link_here.png\" style=\"width: 66.6%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" /> <br /> <p><b>You are briefing publications on embargoed news and want to let Techmeme know:</b> Larger companies often give us a heads-up on major announcements, because it helps us post as soon as possible after the embargo and arrange more comprehensive coverage. Because embargoed news isn't public yet, there's no link for it, so you can't submit via our online form. So instead, you can submit details via <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/feed.xml#\" id=\"embargo-link\">this special email address</a>. To ease the process for both companies and Techmeme, our policy is to automatically accept embargoed information sent to this email address, meaning we won't publish any information sent to us until it's public. So please don't start off by asking if we accept. <i>Yes, we accept,</i> and have handled embargoes from the biggest tech companies for over a decade without incident. When you email, please include as much detail as you can, including the embargo time, any blog posts or press releases, and specifics on the publications you've briefed. Note that this email address will reach a person who then routes the news to a limited set of editors. (It is <i>not</i> an alias that simply forwards to all editors.) Because of this we request you email 12 or more hours before the embargo time if possible. </p> <p><b>Techmeme posted something erroneous or misleading and you want to let us know:</b> Occasionally we flub a headline, or mention a detail from a story that was later corrected unbeknownst to us. In scenarios like this, we definitely want to know so we can fix our headline, or, less commonly, remove or replace our headline, so please use <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/feed.xml#\" id=\"editorial-link\">this email address</a> to reach us. Note that you can also use this email address for sending other information or even news tips that can't easily be conveyed by a single URL (making it hard to use <a href=\"https://techmeme.com/tip\">this form</a>.) Please note that while we always read these emails, in many cases, we don't have time to reply.</p> <p><i>As a bonus, here are a few non-editorial scenarios for contacting us: to place ads on Techmeme, <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/feed.xml#\" id=\"sponsor-link\">email us here</a>, to inquire about our media monitoring and summary services, <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/feed.xml#\" id=\"service1-link\">email us here</a>, and for matters unrelated to all of the above, use <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/feed.xml#\" id=\"service2-link\">this email address</a>.</i></p>  </p>",

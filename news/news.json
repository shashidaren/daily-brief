One quick thing to note – it seems Wellbots has mixed up photos for this model with another, but the only version of the E28 that exists is the one with the deep cleaner. While it launched in April with a $1,300 MSRP, that full price sits down at $1,000 these days, which has only seen a few discounts to $850, $800, and the $785 low last seen during July’s Prime Day event. The deal here is landing the costs just $5 above that one-time low, saving you $210 off the going rate for the second-best price we have tracked. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/09/19/anker-eufy-e28-hydrojet-robot-cleane-790-exclusive/#more-1162092\">more…</a>",

Things start with the base FamiLock E34 Smart Lock at $179.98 shipped, <a href=\"https://eufy-us.sjv.io/qzPX6q\">matching the direct website pricing</a>, while the more advanced FamiLock S3 Smart Lock is down at $229.48 shipped (matching its <a href=\"https://eufy-us.sjv.io/qWDz3y\">direct pricing</a>), and the most advanced FamiLock S3 Max Smart Lock at $279.98 shipped (matching its <a href=\"https://eufy-us.sjv.io/DW0yGd\">direct pricing</a>). These three models usually go for $280, $350, and $400 at full price, respectively, which we last saw drop to these all-time low prices back during Christmas sales, while we also saw some shorter-term dips to these rates in early January. Now, you’re getting the first shot to grab them at their best prices in 2026, saving you $100 or $120 off the going rates. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/anker-palm-vein-recognition-eufy-matter-smart-locks-from-180/#more-1192434\">more…</a>",

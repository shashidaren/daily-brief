Now, the brand’s official Amazon storefront is offering a new, ridiculously thin 0.2-inch 5,000mAh unit, which is easily among the thinnest MagSafe power banks we have ever seen. It hit Amazon earlier this month carrying a $100 price tag, although it’s now down to $49.99 shipped – a straight-up 50% markdown as a solid launch deal. It could also be an early price correction rather than a super aggressive launch deal, but it’s a solid price, nonetheless, for what is arguably a unique and wildly thin power bank for your EDC.

The predecessor model carries a $6,098 tag at full price, with it regularly keeping under $5,000 most of the time, so it’s safe to say that this new model’s MSRP will land somewhere around those rates. Along with the initial discount, the brand is also promising up to $1,000 in installation subsidies when grabbing the station bundled with the brand’s new Smart Home Panel 3.

While it sports a $170 MSRP, you’ll more regularly find it floating around $130 at full price since its newer third-generation model released, with discounts having gone as low as $95 over the year, which last popped up back during July’s Prime Day event. Last week’s Prime Big Deal Days event kept things at $100, but now you can score it back at the annual low for the second time ever. The deal gives you a 27% markdown off the going rate (44% off the MSRP), cutting $35 from the tag here, and saving you a total $75 off the MSRP that you would pay elsewhere, for another shot at the best price of 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/10/13/marshall-emberton-ii-portable-bluetooth-speaker-95/#more-1168493\">more…</a>",

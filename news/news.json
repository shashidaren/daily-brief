This Switch 2-compatible memory card typically goes for $55, so you’re looking at a straight-up 36% discount on it at the moment. It fell to $33 last month during the holiday sale, and today’s deal lands it within $2 of that all-time low price. The 512GB model has already climbed to $120 – about $20 more than its usual $100 price point – so you might want to jump in and snag the 256GB version while the deal is still live and is going for less than its launch price.

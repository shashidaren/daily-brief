You’re saving $400 off the tag with this deal for the all-time lowest price we have tracked, while also scoring $266 in FREE gear (a steel cable lock, helmet, waterproof backpack, and large cargo basket) and a mystery gift pack like we saw during last month’s sales events.

This particular set of the brand’s latest lavalier microphone with two transmitters, one receiver, and charging case typically goes for $330, so you’re looking at a straight-up $70 discount on it today. The Mic 3 is the brand’s new release that hit the scene in August, and today’s deal lands as its first discount. Deals on DJI products have been hard to come by lately thanks to spotty stock across retailers – even Amazon mostly shows third-party listings like this one for the Mic 3 set at $259.

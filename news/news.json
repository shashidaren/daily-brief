Prices have been updated below. We also recently dropped our <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/26/tested-anker-solix-c2000-gen-2-power-station-next-wave-backup-support/\">hands-on review of the Anker SOLIX C2000 Gen 2 Power Station here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anker SOLIX is joining its competitors in bringing back <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/Xm30xg\">previous holiday savings in the form of its latest Winter Sale</a> that is offering up to 65% discounts and FREE gifts with select units. One unit I want to point out is <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/kODyWd\">Anker’s SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station at <strong><s>$1,899</s> $1,799 shipped</strong></a>, which matches the price we’re seeing at Amazon, though be sure to clip the on-page 5% off coupon. It may have a $3,999 MSRP direct from the brand, but at Amazon you can find it starting between $2,399 and $2,599. It’s mostly been keeping above $2,000 since December, which is when we saw the $1,799 low from Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales rise in price. You’re looking at the next-best rate today that even beats out the previous New Year sale by $100, with $700 struck from the going rate ($2,100 off the MSRP), making this quite the surprise offer. Head below to check out the full lineup for Anker’s SOLIX Winter Sale while it lasts through the week.</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/02/anker-solix-winter-sale-f3800-1899-more-from-150/#more-1188644\">more…</a>",

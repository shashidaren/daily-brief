Starting on the lower end of the pricing, you can currently find <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/kOLMaV\">Anker’s SOLIX C1000 Gen 1 Portable Power Station bundled with an expansion battery and a water-resistant bag for <strong>$729 shipped</strong></a>, which beats out its bagless option at Amazon by $141. This package would fetch you $1,898 without any discounts, and hasn’t been featured like this in past sales, instead being split into two separate bundles. Considering the expanded setup has gone as low as $699, and the water-resistant bag on its own has gone as low as $80 (meaning $779 total with their best pricing), this bundle with all three certainly seems to be the lowest price you could score them with, complete with $1,169 savings. There’s also the newer and more compact <a href=\"https://ankersolix.pxf.io/6yjWd3\">C1000 Gen 2 Power Station down at <strong>$429 shipped</strong></a>, and matching its Amazon pricing.

Going for $310 at full price, we’ve mostly seen it hanging down around $250 during the last few months of holidays, with occasional dips to $240 and the first appearance of this same rate post-Cyber Monday, followed by its second appearance as a more short-term Lightning deal. Now, you’re getting a third chance to score it at the best price we have tracked over the last year, thanks to the return of this $74 markdown, making it a more budget-friendly model than its newer dual-zone and wheeled counterpart that is sitting $114 higher, which does still come in lower than some premium brand models. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/23/bougerv-53-quart-portable-fridge-freezer-at-236/#more-1189238\">more…</a>",

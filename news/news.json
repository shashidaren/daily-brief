While this is a versatile robot for in-ground of above-ground pools, folks with above-ground swimming holes can save a bit more by going with the Scuba SE Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner at <strong>$139.99 shipped</strong>, which has been serving my brother well for over a year now. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/02/aiper-scuba-s1-robot-pool-cleaner-480/#more-1186000\">more…</a>",

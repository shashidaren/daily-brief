While it is listed with a $700 MSRP direct from the brand, we’ve been seeing it hold out more often at $600 there, while starting at that rate over at Amazon. Discounts have been rarer and rarer since tariffs began weighing heavier on the American market in 2025, though we did last see it fall lower back during Black Friday when it hit its $500 low. If you missed out on that price, you’re getting the next-best rate here while these savings last, giving you $50 off the going rate (and $150 off the MSRP) for an e-scooter that has become <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/09/review-segway-ninebot-e3-pro-electric-scooter/\">my new go-to since going hands-on in our review last year</a>.

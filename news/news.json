The brand’s official storefront on Amazon is now offering its ES controller for $22.49 and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDQLV9PM?tag=karthikl-20\">ES Pro controller for <strong>$25.49 Prime shipped</strong></a> (a $6 delivery fee will apply otherwise). That’s a 10% and 15% discount on the ES and ES Pro models, respectively, marking the lowest prices we’ve tracked for them to date. While not a huge markdown, these are still noteworthy deals that drop already-affordable controllers to new lows. You can get the standard ES controller in Grey, while the ES Pro is available in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDQLV9PM?tag=karthikl-20\">Black</a> and White colors.

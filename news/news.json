It would normally cost you $180 at full price direct from the brand, though at Amazon, it’s been spending the time since May down at $159, with discounts only having gone as low as $146. Today’s deal gives you a $24 markdown off the going rate ($45 off the MSRP), landing it at the best price of the year and among its lowest rates overall – just $2 above the all-time low. Sadly, the battery-bundled package is keeping higher at <strong>$205.44 shipped</strong> right now. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/17/attachment-capable-40v-16-inch-greenworks-string-trimmer-135/#more-1176744\">more…</a>",

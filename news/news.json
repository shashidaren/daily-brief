Carrying a $599 MSRP, though usually starting lower at $529 at other marketplaces like Amazon, we’ve been seeing it regularly marked down between $349 and $339 with discounts since October, with this rate only beaten by the $315 and $299 prices that popped up during Black Friday and Christmas sales. While this current sale continues, you’ll be getting $207 off the going rate ($277 off the MSRP) for the third-lowest price we have tracked. Be sure to check out the other RIVER power station deals we’ve gathered below, as well as all <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/05/ecoflow-new-year-sale-power-station-savings-from-86/\">the other EcoFlow New Year deals here</a>, complete with bonus savings. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2026/01/08/ecoflow-river-power-stations-starting-from-180/#more-1187029\">more…</a>",

Don’t forget to <em>clip the $200 off coupon</em> to see the discounted price during checkout.

Today’s deal shaves $900 off its usual going rate, landing it $85 below its previous all-time low. There’s also a 34-inch variant of this model at Amazon if you think that might be a better pick overall for your desk, and it’s fetching $729 at the moment with a relatively lighter deal.

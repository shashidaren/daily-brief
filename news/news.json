This is the newest ride from Navee that has been going for $1,500 since its release in early November, though it starts off higher from $1,600 at Amazon. Despite this higher starting rate, we’ve only seen one previous discount coming from its Amazon storefront, which dropped costs to $1,400 mid-December. Now, you can score an even larger $200 markdown off the going rate that lands it at a new all-time low price. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/12/29/navee-xt5-pro-off-road-electric-scooter-new-1300-low/#more-1185623\">more…</a>",

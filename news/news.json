This is regularly a $1,550 notebook that’s powered by AMD’s Ryzen 7 260 octa-core processor and an RTX 5060 GPU, and it’s now seeing a straight-up $500 discount. We’ve seen the Intel-powered Legion 5i variant of this notebook go for less, but today’s deal at Walmart marks the lowest price we have tracked for this model, delivering serious value for folks looking for a reliable machine for gaming.

While it has gone a little further in past years, you’re still looking at a $150 markdown that lands it at the best price of the year. Of course, you could save a bit more by choosing the brand’s smaller Classic Series 4.5-Quart Tilt-Head Mixer at $279 shipped, or the Artisan Mini 3.5-Quart Tilt-Head Mixer at <strong>$299.95 shipped</strong>. I’ve also collected many of my favorite attachments for these mixers below, as well, which only expand their versatility and prove even more why these are the last mixers you’ll ever need to buy for at-home baking, cooking, and much more. </p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/28/kitchenaid-stand-mixers-attachments-black-friday-from-50/#more-1180309\">more…</a>",

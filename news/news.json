Outside of these occasional discounts, which we usually see during specific holiday seasons and Prime Day events, you’d have to pay $550 for this handy multi-styler at full price. Over the year, we’ve only seen five discounts, with today’s rate only beaten out by a one-time fall to $375 back in July. While that rate is not coming back right now, you can score it at the next-best price, courtesy of this $150 markdown – and it’s here just in time for your holiday shopping needs!</p>\n\n\n\n <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2025/11/18/dyson-airwrap-origin-multi-styler-400-2/#more-1177301\">more…</a>",

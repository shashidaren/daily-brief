# Daily Brief — Full Redesign Pack

This pack gives you THREE alternative homepages. Pick one and rename it to `index.html`:

- `index.magazine.html` — Card grid with sidebar (magazine feel)
- `index.newspaper.html` — Minimal two-column list (newspaper style)
- `index.dashboard.html` — Dashboard with embedded widgets

Shared assets:
- `assets/theme.css`, `assets/theme.js` — global theme + dark/light toggle
- `assets/logo.svg` — icon

### How to switch
1. Backup your current `index.html` (e.g., `index.old.html`).
2. Choose one of the 3 files and rename it to `index.html`.
3. Commit & push to `main`.
